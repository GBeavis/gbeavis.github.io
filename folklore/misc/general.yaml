    A film is to be made set on the Campus at York, with Kenneth
    Branagh producing and maybe directing. Apparently a couple of
    students with poncy names sleep with lots of women, drink coffee
    in Derwent Cafeteria (sic) and steal a several million pound
    painting from Heslington Hall. Its called `Big Soft Lads' and was
    embarrassingly written by an ex-student.

    Blackwell's Bookshop used to have a cat (although residents of
    Alcuin used to claim it as theirs). It was always known as the
    `Bookshop Cat' (or `Alcuin Cat') and in fact had no
    name. (University Magazine Dec 1994)

    Every so often, there is a smell that covers the whole of
    campus. Is smells of decaying organic matter. The smell is not the
    result of letting incontinent waterfowl loose on Campus, but is
    instead from a nearby sugar factory (probably 10 miles to the
    north). Whenever Campus is downwind of the sugar factory, it
    smells.
