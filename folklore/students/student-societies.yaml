    The police once turned up at Langwith porters with a warrant for
    the arrest of the chairman of the gun club and the AU president,
    having noticed that the gun clubs gun license was years out of
    date.

    A group from Aaardvark (called the Elasticated Gentlemen) were the
    last people to perform at the York Arts Centre before it closed
    down, on 12th August 1995. The audience numbered 35.

    The web pages of the Conservative and Unionist Association were
    hacked into late one night and all the pictures changed to
    pornographic images. The hacker then emailed a press release to
    the news agencies.

    At one point (in about 1988) there was a society called the York
    Student Feudalists, who proposed a complete reworking of the
    constitution of the SU. It modelled itself on feudal arrangements,
    and had, as one of its requirements, that the elected student
    governing body had to parade through campus encouraging all to
    come participate in the meeting. When the actual meeting came for
    YSF's changes to be approved, they were voted down, but the
    turnout for the meeting was amazing. this was, YSF's originator
    claimed, the entire point - to get people to come along to the
    meetings and take part.

    The winning act in the 1993 RAG Lack of Talent contest was to
    drink a pint of lake-water and throw up. As an encore, this act
    included mixing live maggots with the lake water. However, the
    contest was so close that it was decided by two people having a
    swimming race across the lake naked.

    A previous act for the RAG lack of talent contest (in 1992?)
    included someone defecating on stage in time to eating a
    Mars-Bar. After this contest, some provost insisted that the acts
    should be done in better taste.

    Every year, RAG try to get into the Guinness book of records. In
    1991, they made the longest human caterpillar. In 1992, they
    unsuccessfully tried to break the record for the longest flight
    made by a paper aeroplane.

    There was once (January 1992 - October(?) 1995) a society on
    Campus called ``Aaardvark'' that used to cater to the needs of the
    sillier members of Campus by bringing them together and organising
    all kinds of Shenanigans, producing Magazines and TV programs, and
    generally bringing a smile to people's faces. Some of their pranks
    included dressing up in labcoats while offering to polish people's
    socks, having a dry-land swimming-race on Porter's trolleys,
    distributing spoofs of the "Daily Info" called ``Daily Dis-info'',
    and sabotaging the 1995 Open day by putting up strange notices
    (Anyone remember "Campus Goose Services"?). The Aaardvark web
    pages live on in exile, in somewhat original and somewhat
    different forms.

    The reason Aaardvark starts with 3 'A's is because at the time it
    was founded, there was already a society (anarchist society)
    called "Aardvark".

- T: >
    When Aaardvark placed a notice on Campus saying ``Please do not
    throw stones at this notice'', someone wrote a letter to the
    Guardian newspaper asking ``Is it true that somewhere in North
    Yorkshire, there is a notice that says `Please do not throw stones
    at this notice'?''. Since then, there have been several replies
    prompting the original letter to get printed over and over
    again. The letter even appears in a compilation book of letters to
    the Guardian. (There exists/existed a picture of this on the
    web. Somewhere)

    These letters to the Guardian are part of the Aaardvark
    shenanigan.

    RaveSoc (AKA Disco Biskit) used to organise raves on Campus in
    '91-92. They had to be banned because they were attracting too
    many teenagers, and drugs were being sold at these raves.

    In 1982, the anarchy society flour-bombed an exec-meeting. (Such
    societies no longer appear in the SU handbook)

    The debating society re-appeared in 1992 after it had disappeared
    for ``reasons legendary in the SU corridor'' (quote from 1992 SU
    handbook). It seems they put posters up around campus advocating
    the eating of babies (or something) and caused a riot. The posters
    were just intended to catch peoples attention and get them along
    to the debate.

    In 1987, there was a Campus wide dating agency called ``Fix-it'',
    but it wasn't a success.

    There used to be a sad case of a student who was totally out of
    touch with reality, spent all her time at university MUDding on
    the computers, going beserk in the terminal rooms (usually the
    Derwent SGI room) and screaming her head off at the
    furniture. People often found it amusing to log her off and watch
    her go mental.

    Until the early 90s there was a Computer Society on
    campus. Although not as popular as it had been in the late 70s
    this still ran trips, social events and the odd talk up to about
    1990. It is fair to say that the society moved from being
    something the CS department liked to something it rather preferred
    to ignore. It was best known for drunkenness, and for ``Tabloid
    Teletype'', a fairly scurrilous magazine mixing local satire, net
    humour and similar. This was originally lineprinter output, though
    Pete Fenelon took it to laser-printed format (plain ASCII text) in
    '87 and to typeset format in '89. Some of the later issues
    (1990-1) were A5, had proper card covers and rather handsome, but
    by that time there were less and less original articles!

    W.E.S. (Women's Engineers Soc) has more men than women. (It
    certainly did once upon a time.)
