    When there was a single dashed line down University Road, a pair
    of scissors was painted in the middle one night by inhabitants of
    Alcuin A block (the ``Alcuin Separatist Movement''), namely James
    Proctor, Doug Winter, Tim Hughes, Emma Rusby, Alison Boorman, and
    a couple of others. We have a photograph of the scissors taken by
    Mike Cohler, and another taken by Nick Jackson. The University
    News Sheet (July 1992) puts the date as 8 June, and carries yet
    another photo.

    A Chinese student living in Vanbrugh X-Block was thrown out of the
    University for eating the ducks. The cleaners found the feet in
    his bin. (Possibly in 1992, there was something in Vanbrugh JCR
    publicity about it.)

    You can get kicked out of university for killing a duck, but not
    for killing another student (you can return after the end of your
    prison sentence).

    The car crashed opposite Alcuin bank: It seems that -pete. was
    prescribed some kind of medication by the Medical Centre, but not
    informed that it wasn't a good idea to drive under the influence
    of it. This coincided with -pete.'s attempt to break his personal
    record for driving from home to the office. At some point along
    University Road, he kind of missed the turning and ended up
    halfway up the bank on the Langwith side of the road (just under
    the bridge that you can't fall off). He's reputed to have said
    ``No, keep the stopwatch running'' as he reversed back down the
    bank.

    York is a fairly quiet University in terms of student politics,
    but there have been a number of strikes and occupations by
    students in the past. Heslington Hall was occupied twice in the
    late 60's, and Central Hall in 1993. There was also an
    unsuccessful attempt to picket examinations in 1975. YUSU
    organised a sit-in at Heslington Hall in 2002 which ended when
    Admin set off the fire alarm.

    A student once explained to a lecturer that he was late to the

    Some students ``accidentally'' created a local newsgroup
    alt.york.kitchen-possy in May '97. (It was supposed to be -posse,
    but they couldn't spell.) The original version was a mailing list
    set up as a means of gossip amongst the inhabitants of Goodricke
    B-Block first floor (Eastern End) during the academic year
    1994-95. Fiona Wright, the student who originally set it up, kept
    trying to remove her name from the e-mail headers, but other
    people kept putting her back on again. (The newsgroup now seems to
    have been discontinued.)

    The green Physicist: Someone once went to a Freaksoc meeting
    dressed as a troll, and dyed themselves green as part of the
    effect. To do this they filled a bath with water, added green dye
    and got in. Needless to say they didn't do it in their own

    found their tub had been dyed permenantly green.

    In the 70s there were a lot of cheaply made soft-core movies
    around. One of the main writers was a student at York. Well known
    around campus, he was filmed in the JBM library for a documentary
    about the films. He explained that he didn't write the sex scenes,
    he just left gaps in the script that the director filled in with
    the appropriate activity.
