    The long running campus newspaper ``Nouse'' was so called by its
    first editor as a pun on the words ``No use''.

    In 1992, there were plans to merge Vision and Nouse, since the SU
    didn't fancy paying for two newspapers and controlling
    neither. There has been some merging as a result of SU budget
    cuts, but both newspapers still claim editorial independence.

    URY was the first licensed independent radio station in the
    UK. (See the URY Homepage more information.)

    URY was set up with help from John Peel, who DJ'ed the first show
    in June 1968 after sending in a tape from London.

    URY can be picked up in Algeria, but not in Langwith. Several
    people have written in from Scandanavia, Dubai etc, having
    listened to the station. (Now out of date).

    First URY transmitter was ex-Royal Navy Submarine equipment, which
    is why it had such impressive range. (This transmitter was
    certainly used in tests beforehand.)

- T: >
    Even parts of campus very near URY can't pick it up nowadays. Some
    people are bothered by this. (Now out of date).

- T: >
    URY was not actually broadcast in the conventional sense, but was
    cabled around campus. To pick it up properly, you had to be in one
    of the buildings which has been fitted with an induction loop
    around the top, which carries the signal. (The same principle is
    used to transmit to hearing aids in public rooms.) The loop
    directs the signal down into the building, and also up to the
    ionosphere, from where it bounced down to other
    countries. Goodricke A and B blocks are different - the signal
    cable was connected to the metal structure of the building!)

    URY Today (2004). URY has been transmitted "properly" (with their
    own AM transmitter) since 1999 or so. This has eliminated most of
    the "blackspots". It certainly works in Langwith, or at least it
    did when your author lived there in 2001-2.

    URY have been planning to move to FM since 1992, but have been
    consistently refused a licence by the authorities. (The main
    sticking point is the huge cost demanded by said authorities for
    said licence). (URY now broadcasts on FM using a restricted power
    license for 2 weeks a year).

    URY once (May 1987) mistakenly broadcast that the Minster was on
    fire. Some students got a taxi to go and watch, but found it was
    merely a factory yard nearby that was burning. They returned to
    campus, and demanded that URY pay their taxi fares.

    YSTV was the first licensed independent TV station in the UK.

- T: >
    YSTV held world record for longest program directed by a single
    person.

    YSTV missed the death of General de Gaulle through not listening
    in to Radio 2 through the morning he died.

    The University News Sheet, forerunner to the current Magazine, was
    conceived as a stop-gap but continued (against the wishes of all
    it's editors) for more than 200 issues.

    In 1992, someone was selling a spoof of Vision called Blinkered
    Vision. This resulted in someone from the SU threatening to
    sue. (Question: Is there any more folklore on Blinkered Vision?)
