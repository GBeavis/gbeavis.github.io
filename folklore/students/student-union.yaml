    A Winnie the Pooh soft toy once got elected to DPS over a SWSS
    candidate. He was rapidly no confidenced though, and now cannot
    stand for another sabbatical post.

    The SU president in 1985-86 (Russell George) only stood as a joke
    and didn't intend to get elected. This happened again in 2008/09
    was nominated by friends as his pirate alter-ego "Mad Cap'n
    Tom". He won by a landslide after the highest ever election
    turnout.

    During the late 60s, early 70s, a dog stood for SU
    presidency. (Did it win?)

    The Ideal UGM would have all 5000 or so students attend, but
    there's no venue on campus large enough for that many students.

    Every time there's a referendum for a student council, it's held
    in the summer term (this happened in 1994 and 1995). People
    complain that too many people have gone home during the summer
    term to vote.

    Tony Palmer, when campaigning for Deputy President was
    photographed kissing a baby. He also campaigned dressed as a mad
    cow; and together with Ben Drake turned a YSTV interview into an
    attack on media budgets.

    -bat once stood for SU prez as an Independent candidate. His
     posters consisted of the lenses of his mirrorshades and a mass of
     hair, and nothing else. Everyone knew who it was.

    The SU used to have offices in Goodricke, on the corridor now used
    by YSTV and Maths.

    Students have been campaigning for an SU building/venue since the
    time the uni was built. In 1994, after a debate attended by only
    18 of 5000 students and a referendum, it was decided to convert
    Goodricke Squash courts into an SU building.

    Not many people know that there was a Union Building before
    this. Admittedly it was a tent, but it stayed up for a day, and
    was generously provided by the student society Aaardvark.

    York used to hold the record for the greatest number of people to
    stand on a postbox.

    Goodricke JCR used to make T-shirts with the college motto:
    ``Goodricke Gorillas - where the Balls are'' in reference to the
    sculpture of algol.

    An inflatable sex doll and a Hoover have been elected onto
    Goodricke JCR at some time.

    Sometime in the 70s some pranksters faked a nomination for EVP, and
    since it was the only nomination for the post, this unperson
    ("David Jones") was elected unopposed. The first GM convened and
    he didn't show up, so he was no-confidenced and another election
    was held. The story made the tabloids.
