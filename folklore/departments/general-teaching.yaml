    When the University was new, Oxford University proposed that they
    should run training courses for the academic staff here (implying
    that York needed help in the world of academia). The then

    would of course train an equal number of Oxford staff ... and
    Oxford quietly dropped the idea.

    In 1992, there were plans to extend the teaching hours from 8:15
    to 20:15; have no unified lunch-break; and have teaching hours on
    Saturday from 8:15 to 13:15. Later, the plans were changed to just
    have an extra teaching hour at the end of the day. Eventually, it
    was figured out that it wasn't necessary to extend teaching hours
    if more efficient timetabling was done.

    lectures in town (in King's Manor) were at 45 minutes past the
    hour, with a bus between Exhibition Square and Heslington timed to
    get people between the two sites. (Before the University came, the
    Heslington bus service was two return journeys from Piccadilly on
    Saturdays only.
