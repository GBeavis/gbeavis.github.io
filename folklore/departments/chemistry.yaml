    The Fire Brigade, faced with large cupboards full of smouldering
    and potentially nasty chemicals with the labels burned off, simply
    hauled the lot off in to a big heap in the playing fields behind
    the Dept (now the Science Park) and sprayed water on them from a
    cautious distance until they stopped fizzing.

    A large part of A-block was destroyed. Afterwards, experimental
    work was restricted to the other three blocks.

- Tb: >
    When experiments with thiols (chemicals akin to those used to
    scent natural gas) were being conducted in the Department, the Gas
    Board were swamped with calls from Heslington and Badger Hill
    residents about gas escapes.
