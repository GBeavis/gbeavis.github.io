    One lecturer tried to liven up an explanation of oscillations by
    drawing an analogy with what the water does when you `bounce up

    had in mind at the front of the lecture theatre.

    silence

    AS: Is anybody actually here?

    silence

    AS: OK, let's narrow this down. Who's on Saturn?

    biology lab (the maths department is always scraping around for
    places to give lectures), managed to demolish a skeleton of a
    horse at the front of the lab.
