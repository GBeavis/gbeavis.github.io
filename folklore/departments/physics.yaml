    There used to be a statue on the lawn in front of Heslington Hall,
    called Diana the Huntress. It was smashed during an incident
    following the Physics Department Christmas Dinner 1965.

    During the annual Physics vs. Shepherds cricket match, Simon Fox
    was once tonked all over the place by the Shepherds No. 7 earning
    himself the nickname ``The Beast'' since he allegedly went for
    three sixes in a single over. Documentary evidence shows that he
    only went for two but the name is still occasionally mentioned to
    this day.

    The Physical Wrecks (Physics departmental cricket team) needed a
    single off the last over for victory. And the Legendary Gareth
    Chisham with his magnificent forward defensive failed to get it. I
    think it was after this game that Sean Healy refused to play for
    Gareth again.

- Tb: >
    Two runs were needed of that last over, and Gareth's mighty
    forward defence got one -- enough to claim a draw. Sean apparently
    managed to drop three catches in the game, which might have had
    something to do with his lack of eagerness to play any more.

    Three or four years ago there were a number of players who enjoyed
    a tab or two. Phil Holden used to quite regularly bowl with rollie
    in hand and Louis Purver once took a magnificent one handed catch
    at silly mid-wicket, one handed since he had his baccy in the
    other.

    A few years ago there two bowlers from Electronics who were very
    quick. John Dittmer rarely went for more than 10, and any runs
    scored off him were invariably edges that went for four
    runs. During one particularly fiery spell he got a fine edge from
    the batsman. Phil Holden at first slip immediately jumped up to
    appeal for the easy catch that was there for the taking. Wazza
    Chisham at wicketkeeper, out of the corner of his eye sees Phil
    leap in the air and just so he doesn't feel left out decides to do
    the same -- before he catches the ball. Wazza times his jump
    perfectly so that as his graceful leap is reaching its' zenith the
    ball makes extremely rapid contact with his ``box''.

- Tb: >
    Gareth Chisham figures very highly in cricket folklore. He's been
    affectionately known as ``Wazza'' since 1992 when Pakistan last
    toured England with their excellent bowlers Waquar and
    Wasim. Since we all held Gareth in such high esteem we amalgamated
    their names to come up with ``Wazza''. It also had the added bonus
    of having lavatorial connotations.

    There was once a film partially made in the Physics building. It
    was made using the LEED equipment in PC/008 as a rack of ``high

    One of the Electronics Workshop technicians once tried to work out

    Back in the 50s Prof Heavens did some early work on lasers. He was
    told of a paper published by a Russian that he had to read, and
    finally obtained a copy in Russian, and found someone to
    translate. When he got it back he realised that it was in fact
    simply a Russian translation of a paper he had written, complete
    with his name at the top.
