    It is the ``done thing'' in English Department Board of Studies
    meetings that when discussing a particular student, any member of
    the department who has been having a relationship with that
    student should leave ``for a cup of coffee''. Apparently, three
    members of staff once got up to leave when a particular student
    was being discussed.
