    The Computer Science Department won a prize at the robot Olympics
    in 1990 with a robot that alleged it was under neural network and
    computer control, but in fact had only basic collision detection
    plus some random wiggles programmed in. The random wiggles just
    happened to take it round the obstacle course by pure chance. In
    the same Olympics a 100 year automata from the local museum won
    the archery contest.

    A computer science head of department once nearly lost his head
    when, just seconds after having his picture taken next to a large
    Winchester cabinet, something inside broke, the disk slipped loose
    from its housing, sliced through its cabinet and buried itself in
    the adjacent wall.

    Apparently in the late 70's/early 80's, in the infancy of the
    internet a certain group of computer scientists managed to order a
    rocket launcher via the net. Apparently from Columbia. Allegedly
    the only way they found out was when the invoice arrived at the
    comp sci block.

    When compsci got their new HLH Orion computers in '88, there was a
    couple of serious bugs in the system. The first meant that
    terminals would `die' when you logged out, and couldn't be used to
    log back in; vuft would fill up with turned-over keyboards
    indicating the dead terminal. forsyth produced a staff-owned
    setuid root program called clearline that mucked around in the
    kernel to clear up this problem. The suns had passwordless login
    called ``console'' that had staff privs, so it was possible to set
    up a sgid-staff shell purely for running clearline and making
    things usable again.

- Tb: >
    The other, much more interesting bug was that at random, processes
    would flip into root. this lead to numerous people with files they
    couldn't write to, etc., and, after one user noticed her prompt
    had changed to a funny # character, a long battle between numerous
    students to hide root hacks that they could reinvoke, but that
    other students couldn't. Forsyth found this out, and cleaned up
    almost all the hacks. one remained in until the orions were
    dumped. it didn't fire until most of the students responsible had
    left.

    A ``.paranoia virus'' was put into /lib/crt0.o, the file that gets
    linked into every compiled C program, and is the code that
    actually calls main(). it wasn't a virus actually - more of a
    trojan.

    It checked the current process id (using a direct system call
    trap, to avoid invoking any other library functions); if (pid %
    256) == 42 then it would create a file in the current directory
    called ``.paranoia'' with no contents and no permissions to do
    anything on it. The character codes for the string ``.paranoia''
    were hidden in a series of adds and shifts in the code adding to
    the difficulty of the detection.

    This meant that from the moment it was installed, newly compiled
    programs occasionally hatched a .paranoia file... including for
    example ``glide'', the functional language interpreter provided by
    the department, and eventually most of the compilers.

    The trojan even managed to propagate from Orion2 to Orion1.

    The way into the student machines in those days was quite
    elegant. After popping root on the Orion, one student made
    /etc/rc.local writable on one of the disc-less student sun
    workstations. So, if anything needed ``doing'', the extra commands
    were written into that file, which runs as root on bootup, and a
    command inserted to copy the original version of the file back
    over it -- hence, nobody ever logged in as root.

    Since there was no change to the content of any of the system
    files, only a one-bit change in the permissions on one file, this
    remained in place for ages and ages -- a very thorough check of
    the boot partition on the Suns eventually revealed what had
    happened

    To commemorate this, the students in question produced a ``2nd
    year 1993-1994 exam results mug''. The front of the mug says
    ``University of York 2nd Year Computer Science 1993/4''. The bit
    opposite the handle has a trophy with the old ``University of
    York'' logo on it. The back says the following: ``The worst year
    group in the history of computing''.

    For most of 1986/7 the more net-minded students used to read
    Usenet by (ab)using a guest account on one of the staff Vaxes. The
    username was guest, the password was (unsurprisingly)
    visitor.... At least one student was a member of the Clayton
    E. Cramer For President campaign. (CEC was one of the best of the
    early flamers)

    The 1987/8 intake was almost on a par with the 1992/3 one --
    including the two students who basically lost Computer Science
    students email and news access for some time -- largely due to
    huge bounces. During this period, CS undergrads used a number of
    sly means to keep a net presence -- for some reason the Sun
    workstations still had mail and news, and many CS students became
    active ``computer reps'' for societies and used CompServ
    facilities.... SOCSnnn accounts were something of a hotbed of
    illicit compsci networking.

    In 1993, the compsci newsgroups were dominated by discussions on

    In 1994, a lecturer set an exam question the Teaching Quality
    Assessment inspectors declared to be `tasteless'. The lecturer
    decided to keep the question in the exam anyway. The question was
    about a theme park called something like `Oop North'. You can buy
    lard in the souvenir shops. The idea was to categorise everything
    into a relational database.

    A fly lands on the surface of a slide-projector and is projected
    to the screen. The lecturer says something about there being a bug
    in the program.

    Andrei Ellman once entered a computer science lecture mid-lecture
    and gave the lecturer a slice of toast. (However, Andrei had
    discussed this with the lecturer beforehand.)

    In 1994, head of Computer Science department gives a talk to tell
    students to turn up on time, since Teaching Quality inspectors are
    in. Several students walk in as he finishes.

    Teaching is rated `outstanding' in 1994. One lecturer is called on
    his portable phone mid-lecture to be told he had been rated
    outstanding. Another, using hand-puppets to liven up the lecture
    makes the puppets say ``yes, the TQA inspectors were nasty''. That
    night, the lecturers head off to the Charles for a pissup.

    One lecturer deleted MSDOS.SYS and IO.SYS from his new PC ``to
    save space'', with the expected lack of functionality. How he
    managed to unhide them and remove the read-only bit from them is

    that they were important files...

    Another senior computer scientist left his first PC, a 386/DX33,

    Computer Science was the first department to have local
    newsgroups. This was before CompServ discovered Usenet News. This
    is why the york.cs.* groups were originally called york.*. The
    electronics dept. also had a newsfeed back then, but they didn't
    seem to have local newsgroups.

    The newsgroup york.student (now york.cs.student) was originally

    group.

    Back in the days when V/058 was full of terminals, a bottle of
    Newcastle Brown was spilled into the keyboard of one. It no longer
    worked. In order to hide the evidence, those present carried out
    the following tasks: Swapping the physical location of a goodly
    number of the terminals so that any mapping from serial no. to tty
    line was N&ampV. Swapping keyboards around so the keyboards no
    longer matched the vdus (same reason). Breaking root (not
    difficult on an HLH Orion 1/05) to wipe out wtmp and all other
    system accounting logs so nobody could see who was logged in at
    the time.

    The Compsci department, as of 1992 have offered a course called
    ITBML (Short for Information Technology, Business Managment, and
    Language). Because ``Information Technology, Business Managment,
    and Language'' and ``Eye tee bee em el'' are both a bit of a
    mouthful, ``Itbummel'' is used instead.
