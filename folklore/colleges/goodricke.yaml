    Goodricke college is named after the astronomer John Goodricke who
    discovered the binary system Algol.

    The rough-looking stretch of concrete next to the lake, between
    the bar and the common room, is called Goodricke Beach.

    Until the summer 1989 (or was it 1988?) revamp, Goodricke bar
    contained the `famous' Goodricke Table. This was a wooden table
    with various college graffiti, famous names and so on, which
    resided at the lakeward end of the bar area (which was not as
    large as it is now). In 1989, in revenge for events unknown, a
    party of students from another college kidnapped said table and it
    went out of circulation for a while. It was rediscovered some
    weeks later on the top floor of Alcuin A-Block. This discovery may
    have been in some way related to the flooding of Alcuin (see
    above)
    Another version is that The Goodricke Table was nicked to ``save''
    it during the impending revamping of the bar (the old bar was a
    much more dingy and messy place; much better, too). anyway, it was
    hidden on top of the block to keep it safe, but after all that
    time, it was found to have warped considerably, It was generally
    accepted that they should have just chopped the legs off it, and
    nailed it to the wall.

    Goodricke dukebox hasn't moved since it was installed many years
    ago - all modifications to the building have been carried out
    around it. (Many of the singles in it have also been there since
    it was built)

    The University has mortgaged Goodricke C block, since, should they
    default on the loan the building society wouldn't bother to
    repossess it.

    Person or persons unknown once dragged two KwikSave trollies to
    the third floor of one of the Goodricke blocks, and chained them
    together to extract the two pound coins from the locks.

    One of Goodricke's (or is that Wentworth's) accommodation blocks
    was supposed to be temporary. It was built during the 70s, and was
    supposed to be taken down in the 70s. It's still there today.

    The 8-jetted fountain in the Goodricke water-court (outside G022)
    was installed at the end of August, 1996. It replaced a previous
    installation which had a series of mushroom shaped water features,
    but which had in recent months become merely a perching place for
    tired moorhens.

    The new water jets were purchased at huge cost from a
    little-renowned water sculpture artist.
