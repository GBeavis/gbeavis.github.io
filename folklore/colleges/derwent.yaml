    Derwent is named after the former local authority, Derwent
    District Council of the East Riding of Yorkshire County
    Council. No doubt this was named after the nearby river Derwent.

    A couple of chaps on the way back from the village late one
    evening (in 1988/9) claimed to have seen a lion cub somewhere
    between the church and Derwent College. You can imagine the
    response this got from Derwent Porters, who suspected imbibition
    as the cause. It was later uncovered, however, that an escaped
    lion cub was indeed in the area (whether this was simply by
    further sightings by night patrol or by some other means we know
    not), and the animal was I believe rounded up and caught. The
    story was carried in a copy of Vision at the time, if anyone wants
    to check the archives.

    Certain anonymous RAs in the Electronics department spent an
    entire afternoon forging tickets to the barbecue, with the aid of
    about 20 grand's worth of computer equipment and software. Test
    subject gained admission.

    Another successful method of entry to the barbecue was via a hot
    air balloon.

    On a Friday night In 1994, the tires of the car belonging to a
    friend of the Provost were slashed. The enraged provost suspected
    it was someone from ground floor D block (GFD), who had a
    reputation for trouble. At 8:30 the next morning, he woke up the
    entire corridor and threatened to throw people out of their rooms
    if nobody owned up. Following several more incidents over the next
    10 days, the police caught a local youth in the act.

    Looking at the walls from across Derwent Balcony (above the
    Derwent well area), you can see painted on the wall alternative
    designs for Campus.

    There is a Derwent Challenge (cf the Wentworth Challenge) - to
    walk on the very smalll ledge above the open flood drain at the
