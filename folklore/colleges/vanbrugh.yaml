    Vanbrugh is named after Sir John Vanbrugh who, in 1699, designed
    Castle Howard -- the largest house in Yorkshire.

    The windows in the dining hall had to be replaced a few years ago
    because the glass was being eaten by the lake water from the
    fountain.

    The large expanse of concrete between Vanbrugh and Central Hall is
    called Vanbrugh Paradise.

    X-block was going to be called D-block, until they realised it
    would be abbreviated to V/D block.

    Vanbrugh dining room used to be the only dining room you were not
    allowed to take food into (there used to be a sign saying ``Please
    do not bring any food into the dining room'' -- it has been
    removed since).

    Some people from V/A, V/B, V/C blocks believe V/X block is
    haunted. It is known as ``The Dreaded X block''.

    When a fire alarm in (the detached) Vanbrugh X block went off, it
    triggered the fire alarms in the rest of Vanbrugh (and vice
    versa). So for example, when someone sneezed in V/X block, they
    warned the rest of Vanbrugh too just in case the sneeze triggers
    off a chain-reaction taking out the rest of Vanbrugh. You can tell
    the difference between an alarm in your block and a block that is
    detached from you by the difference in beeps. The first is
    continuous beeps, and the latter is intermittent beeps. The
    Vanbrugh fire alarms are no longer linked in this way.

    In 1988 when there was a Real Fire(TM), the fire brigade had
    trouble trying to persuade the spods in vuft from leaving their
    computers.

    The 1994 fire was started by a faulty stereo in a students room,
    at about 4 in the morning. When he tried to wake up the rest of
    his corridor, they each shouted ``**** off, I'm asleep'' (This was
    related to BBC Radio York, anyone get it on tape?).

    In 1991-1992, the railings on Vanbrugh Bar didn't completely shut
    off the bar, and it was possible to put an arm through a gap and
    pull yourself a pint (presumably, the gap may have been wider than
    a pint glass, or a hosepipe was used). After the place was cleaned
    up at midnight, a small number of students would sneak back in and
    give themselves free drinks until 6am. This was before the
    railings were re-built.

    Once when a student quit his course and left his room in Vanbrugh
    a few weeks early, he decided that the room should be turned into
    a free-for-all party-zone by leaving the door open
    permanently. The door was promptly closed by the
    next-door-neighbour who was concerned about getting sleep.

    It was once said that when asked for directions, if you point to
    Vanbrugh, you're usually right.
