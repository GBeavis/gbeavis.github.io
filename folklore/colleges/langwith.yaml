    Langwith college is named after Langwith common, an area of land
    near the university; and the deserted village which stands there.

    There were for some time three infamous barmaids in Langwith,
    operating as a gang, known as the three Ethels (in fact only two
    were actually called Ethel, the third was sort of honourary. She
    was called Sylvia and is still a cleaner in Langwith). They were
    such terrors as could teach any present bar ladies a thing or two,
    both at serving (``get in line'', ``queue up properly'', ``ask
    nicely'', ``where's your glass, I just gave you one not more than
    20 minutes ago, no you can't have a clean one'' etc.etc.etc, all
    the oldies have their favourite stories) and at drinking up time
    (standing on stools and banging trays next to your head to get you
    to leave). This was endured with only the occasional bout of ill
    humour by the student populace for some years, until one (or
    several) of them was very rude to a conference guest (we think
    they poured a pitcher of water over him), and they were
    mysteriously retired off. (There was also the theory that the till
    receipts didn't balance). If you are interested, there's a picture
    of one Ethel in action with a soda syphon in the April '84 Nouse.

    During the summer of 1996, Langwith D block was completely gutted
    and refurbished. This was due to an uncontrollable cockroach
    infestation.

    For a time, there was a tramp living in a bathroom in C block, but
    he was chased away by a cleaner.

    The Langwith pool table (which used to stand where the lift to the
    library is) ended up in the lake in 1994, the culprits were never
    caught.

    Once (1994) when a window was smashed in the main corridor of
    Langwith, the provost punished the entire college by banning all
    JCRC events. It turned out the guilty student was from Wentworth.

    The narrow bridge over the wier next to D block used to be
    stepping stones rather than a solid path. There were also
    underwater lights installed at this point.
