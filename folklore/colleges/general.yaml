    The choice of college assigned to individual students by the admin
    is in fact a psychological experiment to try to create a different
    personality for each college by finding out what sort of person
    each student is before assigning them a college. For instance
    Derwent has a relatively high proportion of students who went to a
    public school.

    The CU plant a Christian in every corridor. (The CU claim they
    don't, and you'd need a lot of admin cooperation to do so.)

    The fire alarms are telepathic and are designed to go off on a
    cold day when you are thinking ``This would be a terrible time to
    have a fire alarm.''

    Every time there is a false alarm in a college, the Fire Brigade
    charges the University several hundred pounds call-out charge.

    Many of the room keys in colleges will open more than one bedroom.

    Female students are not generally given ground floor bedrooms for
    security reasons. (and to encourage the blokes on the ground floor
    to get out a bit).

    Security was tightened up following the murder on campus in
    1992. Peep-holes and chains were put on the doors of all college
    rooms, locks put on most outside doors. Unfortunately, most of the
    chains were badly installed, and the door could be opened even
    with the chain on. The chains were later moved, but the original
    fixing points can still be seen on most doors. (The main use for
    the chains is to keep cleaners out.)

- Tb: "College identity isn't as strong as it used to be."

    The record for number of glasses of wine drunk at a Provost's
    party is 16 (at Vanbrugh).

    Allocation of rooms in college is deliberately engineered to mix
    people of different subjects.

- T: >
    When first opened, the colleges were sex-segregated by corridor.
