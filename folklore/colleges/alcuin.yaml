    Alcuin is named after the 8th century scholar Alcuin of York, who
    was trained in York, and later went on to be an eminent scholar in
    the court of Charlemagne at Aachen.

    In Alcuin courtyard (outside in the quad), you can see some
    evidence that the courtyard was larger before the expansion of
    Alcuin JCR (the giveaway is some steps that seem to lead into the
    wall).

    The Sisters of Mercy made their live debut in Alcuin dining room,
    on February 16th 1981. Their first ever gig kicks off with a
    twisted cover of Leonard Cohen's ``Teachers''.

    Alcuin dining hall closed because superior quality of food made
    everywhere else look bad, and it was cheaper/simpler to close it
    than to raise standards elsewhere.

    The beds in the student blocks are so narrow because the college
    was built with money from the Quakers

    Alcuin's position on the hill gives Alcuin a strong identity and
    makes it's inhabitants snobbish (Alcuin bar faces the rest of
    Campus). Hence: ``Colleges with altitude. Colleges with
    attitude. Alcuin''. It's also the only college with the dining
    room on the 1st floor.

    Alcuin's first Provost was Dr. Bernice Hamilton, originally
    appointed by Lord James (allegedly on Edinburgh Waverley Railway
    Station) to be Dean of Women Students. Hence for some time Alcuin
    was known as the Bernice Oberland.

    Alcuin bar has only recently been converted into an American Theme
    Bar.

    Alcuin bar does cocktails sometimes, but runs out of ice within
    the first few minutes.

- Tb: "Alcuin was/is the only college with a yearbook."

    A- and B-blocks were flooded one night in spring 1989. Bathplugs
    were put in and taps left on in the time-honoured manner. (Don't
    try this at home (or university) kids, it tends to bugger up the
    fire alarms). There was a concert in the dining hall that night -
    it is thought that people were trying to create a diversion so
    they could get in.
