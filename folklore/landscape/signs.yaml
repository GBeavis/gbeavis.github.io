    There are ``Danger, thin ice'' signs on the lake between Vanbrugh
    and Biology, and next to Physics, all year round. I suppose the
    term 'thin' means non-existent as well.

    The newly-erected green signposts have letters that can easily be
    unstuck and re-arranged. Students often take this as an
    opportunity to show off their vocabulary of swear words. One sign
    had ``Routefinder'' changed to ``tour for nerds'', and one by NYS
    travel became ``rude often''; also seen were ``Psychology'' ->
    ``Psychologie'', ``Campus Nursery'' -> ``Campus Nurser''. Possible
    original mistakes on the signs were ``Goodrick'' and
    ``Vanburgh''. Apparently, Admin paid thousands of pounds for the
    signs.
