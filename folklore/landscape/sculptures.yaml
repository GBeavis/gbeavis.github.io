    The thing which used to be next to Central Hall, known as the
    crisp, cornflake etc. was really called ``Mayflower 1''.

    After the admin removed the Mayflower, Aaardvark made a
    papier-mache replica and which was put up between Central Hall and
    Langwith.

    The Mayflower was once turned into a broken smiley face
    (ie. painted yellow, with one black eye somewhere).

    The thing in the middle of the spiral up to the library bridge is
    called the Avocado. It is made with lead from the Minster's
    roof. (In fact, it is an untitled aluminium work.)

    The two balls outside Goodricke library represent the binary star
    Algol, the subject of the work of John Goodricke. When new they
    were lit up, with one globe red and the other blue.

    The sculpture out the back of Goodricke is made from bits of the
    last steam train in York.

    Some years ago (c.1990) there was an exhibition of sculptures (by
    Austin Wright) in the area between the accommodation near the VC's
    house, the Lake, Derwent B block. These were tall, narrow
    sculptures with small (ca. foot square) bases -- an open
    invitation. They were moved, knocked over, stacked up, and thrown
    in the lake over a period of time. And rapidly removed as a
    result.

    Suspiciously similar sculptures can now be seen in the courtyards
    at King's Manor. These are the same sculptures, relocated to a
    safer haven.

    There were once plans to build a new cashpoint machine into the
    statue of the stone Buddha. (Actually, there were plans, but only
    during an Aaardvark meeting.)

    It's not a statue of a stone Buddha; it's not even a stone statue
    of a real Buddha. It's bronze.

    A few years ago there was a plan put forward by an artist to put a
    huge metal rose in the middle of the lake. The thing was to be
    powered by sunlight, and would open and close during the day.

    Family Group, by Henry Moore was lent to the University by the
    artist. It stood for many years on a plinth in front of Heslington
    Hall Yew Garden.

    An unknown (to us) 1970's artist once spent several days erecting
    sculptures made of scaffolding poles next to Alcuin - much to the
    disappointment of the students, who had thought he was going to
    paint the college windows. The sculptures were called `A Frog' and
    `A Railway Station', but were subsequently combined into a single
    large tower by some students. (Exit one irate artist with his
    poles, enter Private Eye, who report the incident.)

    In 1970 there was a sculpture at Langwith, which was so ugly that
    someone tried to blow it up with a home-made explosive device. It
    was eventually removed in 1974.
