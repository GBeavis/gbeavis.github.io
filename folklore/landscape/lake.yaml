    When it was built, it was the largest plastic lined lake in
    Europe.

    There was a fire in biology; water used to put it out drained into
    the lake along with lots of nasties.

- T: "Chemistry don't drain anything into it."

        Neither do any of the other departments. (The water that is
        pumped into it by Physics is just rain-water.

    It is used to drain the surrounding land - if it wasn't there the
    surrounding land would simply be a marsh.

    During a particularly cold spell one winter, the ice was
    sufficiently thick for a mini to be driven out onto it and over
    the fountain -- which wasn't working at the time.

- Fb: >
    The ice was not as thick as expected - the mini fell through the
    ice and is still down there somewhere.

    During a fairly cold spell a few winters ago, someone put a
    college fridge out in the middle of the lake one evening and it
    was nowhere to be seen next morning.

    The fountain used to be higher before it was cleaned and
    redesigned.

- Tb: "The fountain exists to oxygenate the lake water."

- U: >
    The fountain moves around from time to time - it floats on a
    pontoon which is tethered by it's supply pipe.

- Fb: "Only life in the lake is under-evolved eels and over-evolved fish."

    Since 1994, after a summer when the lake turned very green, there
    have been several bales of hay floating around in the lake each
    year. These were said to be intended to improve the quality of the
    lake water (but didn't seem to have much effect).

    In 1993, Vision had an article about the state of the lake. One of
    the professors of Ecology said that in 60-70 years time, the lake
    would become a swamp.

    The lake has always been a source of complaints about the smell,
    as seen in a Nouse article nigh on thirty years ago.

    There is no plant life in the lake because of an over-ambitious
    project to poison the weeds in the lake during the 70s.

    The top pond, next to Derwent dining room, is prone to bad algae
    growth. On some occassions, it has been known to flouresce
    slightly at night. It hasn't done this in a few years: last time
    was about 1991.

    There is a stream flowing into the lake. You can find it by
    looking in the vicinity of Heslington Church (follow the path from
    Derwith car-park to the church).

    There is also a stream flowing out of the lake, it goes behind the
    Sports Centre and under Heslington Lane.

    The fountain in the lake is said to add fresh water and oxygen
    into the lake water. Unfortunately, nobody has the sense to turn
    it off when it's windy. Considering that a fortune must have been
    spent on building covered walkways just so students don't get wet
    when it's raining, someone could at least make sure that nobody
    gets soaked when the spray of the fountain is blown towards dry
    land or a bridge.

    The sub-aqua club were once asked by the admin to dive in and
    check the integrity of the plastic bag that the lake is, but hired
    an environmental health officer to check the water first, who
    pronounced that it would be dangerous to their health to swim in
    it.

- T: >
    The main reason for not allowing swimming in the lake is that the
    original builders threw all their rubbish into it - hence the
    bottom of the lake consists largely of broken pieces of glass.

    If you fall in the lake, you are advised to see a doctor
    immediately.

    After the murder of an open university lecturer, police frogmen
    spent several days trying to find the murder weapon. In the end
    they took a knife from Vanbrugh kitchens, threw it into the lake,
    watched where it fell, and then tried to find that. They couldn't,
    and given that they couldn't find something even when they knew
    where it was, they abandoned the search.

- U: >
    The (original) knife was later found on top of a covered walkway
    anyway.

    There was once a raft moored permanently by Goodricke beach, in
    its latter years it held only a sign ``Keep Off''.

- U: >
    It is believed that the raft could not float, and was supported
    only by duck shit.

- U: >
    The wooden beams on it rotted away and became more and more
    hazardous; it was removed for this reason.

- U: >
    The raft affair just off Goodricke Beach was reputedly sailed
    (post finals) halfway across the lake by several including brother
    of Dr Simon Eveson (maths), journey curtailed by collision with
    fountain mechanism.

    The lake was contaminated in 1974 by a ``mock battle of
    Trafalgar'' involving lots of soot, oil and paint bombs. Large
    numbers of fish died, and the lake had to be dredged. RAG paid the
    costs to the University.
