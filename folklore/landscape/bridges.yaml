    The Goodricke-Wentworth bridge cannot be destroyed by students
    bouncing up and down on it. The fact that it is still standing is
    testimony to that.

    You can tell who thinks this bridge will fall down by seeing them
    jump up and down on it.

    The Goodricke-Wentworth bridge is the scene for the Wentworth
    Challenge, the general idea being to cross the bridge using only
    the girders underneath.

    The Caving Club also have a bridge challenge, which involves
    absailing off one or more of the road bridges in the middle of the
    night.

    Underneath the Alcuin/Library bridge is the entrance to ``Library
    Fell'', now bricked up, that enabled access to the bowels of the
    library. It's believed that the survey for this is in the library.

    Curse on James Wentworth Bridge - not long after its construction
    a particularly superstitious member of the campus media was
    crossing the bridge from James to Wenty with some ``lucky charms''
    which he felt had been bringing him only bad luck, he decided that
    to bring himself good luck he would get rid of them by chucking
    them into the lake, he and at least one other campus journo became
    convinced that these charms had caused the bridge itself to become
    cursed.

    The library bridge was designed to have a Students Union building
    on top of it, which is why it is so wide.

    The rooms under the library bridge (now security, used to be URY
    and the scanner room) used to house the SU shop.

    The bridge connecting the library with the spiral is
    crumbling. Some people have seen bits falling off it. In fact the
    concrete of the Library-Spiral bridge is showing signs of
    deformation and buckling due to the pressure of the Library
    sliding down the hill towards the lake. After rain, water pours
    through hairline cracks caused by the buckling, down onto cars
    passing underneath (and people standing at the bus stop).

    One of the concrete bridges on campus will have to be replaced
    soon. (The development review of 1985 said `within 10 years'. This
    is because the concrete has been attacked by use of chlorides. The
    cost was thought to be about Â£250,000, so the library bridge is
    probably the most likely.)
