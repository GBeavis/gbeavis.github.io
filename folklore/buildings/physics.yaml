    There used to be stepping stones beneath PX001, when the lake went
    right up to the side of the building.

    Colin Johnson inadvertently walked off them while showing
    prospective undergraduates round.

    The stepping stones were filled with land to improve access for
    the disabled, at the expense of many a potentially interesting
    bar-crawl.

    The sound system inside PX001 was upgraded for minimal cost by
    FilmSoc (as they then were) who went round York stealing car
    stereos. (YSC (as they now are) don't use them - they belong to
    admin).

    Many years ago when the roof of the Physics building was leaking,
    a number of contractors were contacted for quotes to fix it, and
    the cheapest was chosen. They came and worked for a few days and
    all the leaks stopped. Several months later, estates needed to do
    some work in the roofspace, and discovered lots of dustbins full
    of water, which the contractor had put under the holes in the
    roof, thus ``solving'' the problem.

    The final solution involved flooding the roof with tar, having
    first covered the rooms below in plastic sheeting to catch
    drips. This did the trick, and left behind enough plastic to keep
    everyone happy for months.
