    Due to the inquoracy of UGMs, the SU building wasn't named for
    more than a year after completion. One of the proposed names for
    the SU building was "Clean Pancake Building". This was supposed to
    capture the mood of the students at the time (1994). Students were
    apathetic and without direction. "Clean Pancake" is meaningless
    and was part of a computer generated phrase. This meaningless
    captures the apathy of the students.

    The SU building used to be called the ``Vaseline Building'', named
    after the well-known petroleum jelly product. This was voted
    through a UGM by members of the Athletics Union. The AU
    subsequently won Â£6,000 from the makers of Vaseline, for ``most
    original advertising of the year''.

        The following year, the AU won the same competition, run by
        Halifax, by floating a raft with a big `X' on it down the
        Ouse, on the day of the Halifax conversion into a bank. One of
        the exec. even changed his name by deed poll from `Antony
        Gareth Elliott' to `Antony Halifax BUSA Elliott'.

    Is now (1997) called the ``Daw Suu'' Building. Named after a
    Burmese pro-democracy activist.

    The SU building is also referred to as the ``Student Centre'',
    since it meant that the signs with abbreviations for Squash Court
    need not be changed.
