    As part of the preparation for Degree Day each year, the ducks and
    geese are rounded up and taken to the south end of the lake out of
    the way. But some of them get away (even the little ducklings).

    There is a duck cull during Christmas (done during Christmas so
    there's no student protest.)

    During the day, the main animals on campus are ducks, geese,
    etc. At night, there's lots of rabbits, and some bats.

    The following have all been caught in the lake (1987-9): eels;
    rainbow trout; carp (common, wild and hybrids); bream; perch;
    gudgeon; tench; chub; roach; rudd.

    A couple of anglers were refused licenses to fish the lake so they
    took their revenge by releasing pike into the lake. The pike did
    OK, growing very big and eating all the other fish, and maybe even
    the odd duck. All the licensed anglers were complaining that they
    were catching no fish, and pike had been spotted. So the
    authorities poisoned the lake to kill the pike, and the story went
    that a dead pike over 5 feet long was found.

    The pike was nicknamed `George' and has been known to attack
    students in boats on the lake.

- Tb: "George the pike is dead."

    The lake grows mutant fish due to radioactive waste being flushed
    into it by one of the science departments (take your pick from
    Biology, Chemistry or Physics).

- Tb: "The large fish in the lake have been seen to eat ducklings."

    At the north side of Spring Lane Bridge, there's a bird
    identification panel.

- Tb: "Some of the campus waterfowl are not native to the UK."

    Back when the lake was built, some ducks and geese were actually
    imported onto the lake. Nobody anticipated the population
    explosion.

    There's one duck with a red and yellow head who's more aggressive
    than the others. He was nicknamed ``Beer Monster'' by students.

    A duck has actually been known to collide with a student whilst
    the duck was flying. (What the student was doing is not recorded.)

    ``Feeding ducklings bread kills them''. The bread expands when
    wet, causing the duckling's stomach to explode. (This message was
    in Daily Info for nearly every day in the summer term of 1993).

    In 2001 the RSPB brought a pair of Ruddy Shelducks to campus and
    released them on the lake. The female flew off shortly after,
    never to be seen again and the male consequently became rather a
    campus celebrity, known variously as the Golden Duck, Fit Duck and
    most commonly Trevor. Trev was the first campus duck to be
    honoured with both his own Facebook and MySpace profiles, along
    with 'Jazzy', a Common Shelduck with whom Trevor was often
    seen. Trevor's six year reign over the lake was ended in the
    summer of 2007 with his untimely death, and he is commemorated in
    his memorial group.
