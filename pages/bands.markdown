This information was donated by the readers of the local Usenet group
york talk, as well as a number of interested readers. Some entries are
expanded on separate pages. There must be more bands that played
University Ents though and it'd be nice to know more about those bands
on the list. So please let us know if there are any missing from this
list.

Bands That Were Here
--------------------

Bands which have played campus, or University events (such as the
Derwent barbecue etc.,)

Jimi Hendrix *
~ Langwith, 1967.

Sisters of Mercy
~ Played their first gig in Alcuin: a charity benefit and they were
  supporting the Thompson Twins. Guitarist Gary Marx had plugged his
  guitar into a record player pre-amp which fed back uncontrollably
  throughout the gig. Von Eldritch turned the delay echo up to
  max. The set ended with a juggernaut howl which might have been
  ``Silver Machine'' but was in fact ``Sister Ray''. The audience got
  the point. The Sisters also played Vanby twice in 1982 and 83, and
  Derwent on 7 Oct 1982.

Marianne Faithful
~ June Ball, 1965.

The Family Cat
~ Played Langwith, but none of the lighting crew turned up since
  no-one had told them about it.

Sunscreem
~ Played Goodricke, and so few people turned up that Tony Palmer ended
  up giving tickets away for free.

Manic Street Preachers
~ Played Alcuin JCR just before they had a front cover on NME.

Carter USM
~ Played Vanburgh Splash (or maybe just Vanburgh) when they were only
  little.

The Primitives
~ Was a bit of a classic gig; they played here in late '86 or early
  '87 (Chris will remember), before they'd quite made it big. They
  ended up accumulating a fairly good York following -- Blonde was
  quite the thing then -- we were lucky enough to have caught them
  early enough.

The Woodentops
~ This was mostly notable for two things -- the amount of booze
  consumed, and Jon Banks getting totally off his face and being
  abandoned by a mutual acquaintance in Heworth, a couple of miles
  from his campus room. He locked himself in the toilet for at least
  an hour and then lay on the floor refusing to move. In the end it
  took two people to carry him back along Melrosegate.

The Men They Couldn't Hang
~

Kingmaker
~ Pete Fenelon reports that ``Kingmaker I remember nothing of, beyond
  knowing that I was there. They were described as the hardest working
  band in Britain at the time and left absolutely no impression on my
  mind''.

Cud
~ Played Goodricke in about 92.

James Taylor Quartet
~ JTQ were pretty good when they played Goodricke in about 96, but
  they were more into smoother funk than insane Hammond-organ TV
  themes by that time...

Dr Phibes and the house of wax equations
~ Played Vanburgh

Pink Floyd
~ Played Derwent Dining Room, supported by Love Sculpture (Rob
  Fletcher was there!).

Muddy Waters
~ In 1968.

Emerson, Lake and Palmer
~ ``including knives in the Hammond stuff''

Genesis
~ 1973 (maybe 72) in Central Hall. Same tour as the Genesis Live album
  recording. This was the tour with the white sheets and the black
  light. P. Gabriel would appear in various fluorescent outfits with
  fluorescent makeup, the house lights would go down and the black
  lights would come on, so all you could see were the sheets and the
  fluorescence. Great stuff.

Roxy Music
~ Played Alcuin, 1973; reputedly the last gig with Brian Eno & Bryan
  Ferry. Booked for £250 just before Virginia Plane hit the
  charts. This was a double bill with Supertramp. £200 taken on the
  door; £350 damage bill for holes punched through the ceiling by
  lighting crew - profit nil.
~ Also in about 1987 (minus Bryan Ferry, no-one turned up, in fact
  people came to Goodricke bar trying to sell tickets for 50p just to
  get people to turn up). Think it was Derwent. They appeared under a
  different name too, this perhaps being one of those `secret' gigs
  that ends up being so secret it is empty.

Bob Geldof and the Boomtown Rats.
~ Central Hall in Feb 1985, but that's a long story.

Martin Stephenson
~ Played in Alcuin (when he was popular), possibly as part of **The
  Daintees**.

Desmond Dekker
~ Played the Derwent BBQ, and Alcuin Freshers Bash 94/95

Dire Straits
~ Played Alcuin in 1978

Kitchens of Distinction
~ In Vanburgh, about 1991

Bucks Fizz
~ Missing one member played Goodricke Summer Ball 1992. Their
  roadie-cum- backing-tape-play-button-presser reckoned ``They're a
  complete bag of shite, total waste of time, I can't believe people
  pay good money to see 'em.''

Bad Manners
~ Played Goodricke Summer Ball, 1991

Dr and the Medics
~ Played in York a few times, including Derwent BBQ, 1994.

Paradise Steel Band
~

Thin Lizzy
~ Played on campus in the 70's

Katrina and the Waves
~ Played Derwent BBQ, 1993.

Big J and the ``We're gonna play one more song, then you can walk on
as much fuckin sunshine as you want'' Piccolo Chickens
~ Derwent BBQ, 1993

Menswear
~ Did short set in Wentworth and graffitied the dressing room.

The Who
~ Played Langwith at "Magic Bus" time and Central Hall at"Tommy" time

Curved Air
~ With Brian Eno - in central hall sometime between 1969-72. Using the
  VCS3 and a STEREO PA! Distraction provided by Sonia Kristina!
  (Stewart Copeland's son was here as a student for a while)

The Strawbs
~ 27 Apr 71 - the From the Witchwood Tour
~ 16 Oct 74 - the Hero and Heroine tour
~ 26 Feb 80 - very shortly before they split up when they would have been playing Heartbreak Hill material
~ Possibly also did a date in 1973 (Bursting at the Seams tour) as well.

Hatfield and the North
~

Caravan
~

Fairport Convention
~ In 1970

Elton John
~ Played Kings Manor in 1970.

Ronnie "plonk" Laine (ex Small Faces bassist)
~

Moody Blues
~ Played Central Hall in 1967

PFM
~ Played Central Hall

Sparks
~ That band with the keyboard guy with the Hitler moustache

Kilburn and the High Roads
~

Al Stewart
~

ELO
~

Soft Machine
~ Did a Workshop in the Music Department One weekend for local bands
  under the York Musicians COOP banner.

Voulez-Vous
~ The Abba cover band played Goodricke dining hall in December 1993.

Mike Fab-Gere

~ Played Vanbrugh `No food or drink' Dining Room, during the autumn
  term 1993. ``I remember the gig well'' says Mike! Check out
  [Mike's web pages][mike fab-gere]

John Martyn
~ Played Central Hall (several times) and Vanbrugh in the 70's. His
  rig varied from the ``built on stage while you watch'' stuff he
  started with to a full PA with 6-foot cubes housing speakers, horns
  etc. in 1978 or so.

Reg Presley
~ The Troggs fellow played Vanbrugh.

Eire Apparent
~ Played Alcuin

John Mayell and his Blues Band
~

New Fast Automatic Daffodils
~ Played Alcuin in 1992.

Cream
~ Were ``supposed to play'' in April or May 1966 - not sure if they
  ever did or not.

King Crimson
~ Sometime in 1969-72, and/or 74-ish. Central Hall, on the ``Larks
  Tongues in Aspic'' tour with John Wetton, Darryl Way, Bill Bruford,
  and some wierd Scot who bashed odd bits of metal on a rack and spat
  blood. 1974, I think. Crowd mostly quiet until they did ``Schizoid
  Man'' for their encore.

Cockney Rebel
~

Heads, Hands and Feet
~ Included Chas and Dave in pre-lovable cockney mode. Played Vanbrugh
  on the same night as The Troggs

Wings.
~ Played a ``secret gig'' under the name ``Swift'', in Goodricke
  Dining room.

Jethro Tull
~ Played Central Hall (8th March 1972) during the Thick As A Brick
  Tour. Apparently during an intense instrumental bit a phone rang on
  stage, the band stopped to let Ian Anderson answer it, and he asked
  the owner of the horse parked in the foyer to move it, as it was
  causing an obstruction. A `stooge' dressed in jockey gear planted in
  the audience leapt up and ran to the back of the hall, followed by
  spotlight!

Lucyfur
~ One of the most well-remembered of the student bands, their play
  list included such songs as `I want to be a ducky'. (I seem to
  recall the SU shop stocked an album of theirs.)

The Incoherents
~ Probably the other well-remembered student bands, were one of the
  best things at the Woodstock concert in 1994. Only did covers, no
  original songs, but could play a bit and sing too.

Del Amitri
~ Played Derwent Dining Hall in '92 (probably). Approximately five
  people bought tickets, so SU Ents opened the doors to anyone --
  about 30 people watched in the end. Between songs, Justin Currie
  (lead singer) said ``This is the first time we've played a dining
  room.'' A few weeks later they made it into the top 10 and appeared
  on Wogan - I'll bet it was the last time they played a dining room.

The House of Love

~ Played Alcuin (also reported as Goodricke) in 1990. The timing was
  excellent, for once: after the posters went up, ``Shine On'' made
  its way into the charts and the tickets sold out. A bloody good gig
  that featured the petes rowing over some `totty'.

  Chris Sampson added that

  > HOL were pretty much state of the art indie at the time and as it
  > was the first time a decent band had played York in years, there
  > was a full turn out from the wrecking crew and a healthy
  > smattering of non-students in the crowd, including the totty in
  > question - part-Gothette, part pre-Raphaelite goddess. As was
  > de-rigueur behaviour for the time, Fenelon was content to stare
  > furtively over the top of his glasses at her from a safe distance
  > of twenty paces, and was - rightly, I might add - furious when
  > French had the temerity to walk up to her and start a
  > conversation. Fenelon went into a monster strop and walked out,
  > missing the entire gig, and leaving about a third of a pint of Sam
  > Smith's OBB undrunk.

The Shamen
~ Played Derwent BBQ and/or Langwith with Psycho Surgeons on support.

Ride
~ Played Goodricke in 89 or 90. So good that Pete Fenelon fell asleep.

The Icicle Works
~ Played Fresher's Ball in 86.

Hawkwind.
~ Played Alcuin in the early 70's.

Cloud Machine
~

Rolf Harris
~ Played the Barbican, but it was organised by the SU. (3 June 1994)
  This was part of the Rock 'n' Rolf 94 tour, following his appearance
  at Glastonbury (I think in '93).

Quark
~ First (and best) support for Rolf.

Funkfish
~ Second support for Rolf, my main memory of them is that they were
  too loud, too crap and went on too long. Many people headed for the
  bar; Rolf subsequently had to cut some stuff (it seemed) from his
  act to finish on time.

Paul McCartney
~ Turned up one day (1969-72 period) and said (you'll have to imagine
  the accent): ``Can I play tonight - Linda's not been on stage before
  and I want to give her a few concerts before going on tour.''  SU
  bod: ``Yes Mr. McCartney of course you can.''

Joburg Hawk
~ An early racially mixed South African Band - played Alcuin and were
  stunning (1969-72 ish).

Fleetwood Mac
~ Also played Central Hall about 1970ish, many walked out, those who
  could - a real case of a band too stoned to play and an audience too
  stoned to notice.

The Bogus Brothers
~ (Blues Brothers copyists) played Central Hall in Feb 1988. Also
  headlined at Derwent BBQ the following year.

The Flatmates
~ Mention must also be made of proto-Blonde contenders The Flatmates
  who played York about 5 times in between 87 and 89, in the process
  becoming firm favourites on the Alcuin juke-box. Their '88 gig at
  King's Manor went down in history when every red-blooded male in
  Alcuin attempted unsuccessfully to cop off with the then bass-player
  Sarah Fletcher.

Thomas Lang
~ Played in about '88-'89, was described by those who went as one of
  the most boring gigs ever.

The Parachute Men
~ Alcuin, '89. Pete Fenelon only noticed them playing a Tom Waits song
  as he walked back along University Road eating a Chinese
  Takeaway. One of those three-bands-and-a-promo nights in Alcuin.

U Slosh
~ Played several times.

The Slits
~ All-girl punk band, played Central Hall in the late 1970's. They
  reputedly had the plug pulled by the hall manager when they
  suggested trashing the place.

Chris Rea
~ Played sometime about 1978, turnout so bad tickets were given away!
  Early on the playlist was `Whatever happened to Benny Santini'.

Stefan Grossman
~ American folk guitarist, appeared in Central Hall in around 1991. He
  announced to the crowd that York should consider itself lucky for
  having whom he considered to be the best acoustic guitar builder in
  the world living within it's walls.

Jools Holland (Jools Holland's Big Band)
~ Played Derwent BBQ in 1989.

The Blue Aeroplanes
~ Played the Fresher's Ball in 1988 (Alcuin, Merrydown Promo)

Diesel Park West
~

Love and Money
~

The Domino Principle
~ Derwent BBQ, Summer 1989

Electric Canned Fruit
~ Played a lot during 1984-86, including the Alcuin thing and Derwent
  BBQ. Who could forget those psychedelic dayglo posters that were
  nicked within minutes of being put up.

Psychedelic Furs
~ Played Derwent, 7 Oct 1982 (supported by Sisters of Mercy).

The March Violets
~ A goth band who did the excellent ``Snake Dance'', Vanbrugh
  Alternative Freshers Ball 15 Oct 1982.

The Pink Leg Slax
~ Another support at the Vanbrugh Alt. Ball.

The Teardrop Explodes
~ Played Central Hall on 12 October 1982 - this was one of their last
  ever dates. Stephen Clarke tells us ``Julian Cope's book gives a
  wonderful description of just how awful they were on this tour, and
  from my recollections of the Central Hall gig, it is pretty
  accurate.''

Prefab Sprout
~ Played Alcuin on 28 January 1984, well before they were
  famous. Possibly Charlie Watts (Rolling Stones) was on drums as
  their regular drummer was ill. Support was The Daintees

The Explorers
~ Seen at Alcuin on 21 May 1985. This band contained two members of
  Roxy Music (Andy McKay and Phil Manzanera).

Steeleye Span
~ Played Central Hall, Summer 1975 - including a performance of All
  Around my Hat- then the title track of their latest LP!

The Incredible String Band
~ Central Hall again, probably 1974.

Brian Eno
~ As well as various appearances with groups (mentioned above), played
  RAG week in Nov 1975.

Captain Beefheart
~ 1980.

The Kinks
~ Did Central Hall in 1974, with an audience of 2,000. (Those were the
  days...) Lead singer Ray Davies got completely trashed on Newcastle
  Brown during the gig. They came and played again once or twice, but
  weren't as good.

10cc
~ Appeared in Central Hall 75 or 76. They were supported by a strange
  band called Trax, consisting of 5 or 6 black guys in glitter and
  platforms. All had bleached blonde hair, except for the keyboard guy
  who was totally bald. And they were LOUD! We all had to retreat
  downstairs.

Philip Goodhand-Tait
~ What can you say about him? Total mediocrity, kept showing up to
  support one band or another. When he got sick of boring us with the
  piano, he pulled out his - harmonium!

Stefan Grossman
~ 1972 or 73 in Derwent with a guy called Dave Evans in support. Dave
  gave a beautiful performance and endeared himself to all. Stefan was
  slick and professional.

Manfred Mann's Earth Band
~ Played Goodricke DR on the ``Blinded by the Light'' Tour. The
  support act was a local put-together band called ``Great Free Teddy
  Bear Offer'' - which looked good on the posters(!). They were
  actually pretty good and got an encore.

Wishbone Ash
~ Central Hall circa 1972. Notable for (besides the excellent music)
  two huge PA horns at the ends of the stage. During the support act
  (name lost to history) they were upended like two great flowers 8
  feet high, 5 feet wide. For the Ash set they were pointed
  forward. This was also one of the first CH concerts where some of
  the local kids showed up drinking from ink bottles. Dunno what the
  attraction was. The porters had fits, of course, but then they
  always had fits at concerts.

Pete Atkin [Pete who?" Ed.]
~ Performances in various DR's around the campus in the 70s (notably
  Langwith and Wentworth) and appearing in CH with songwriting partner
  Clive James (yes, that one) doing "Live Libel", their set of musical
  tributes to "insufficiently neglected modern artists" (e.g. Robert
  Zimmerman, T-Rex etc.) Pete Atkin has a [web page][pete atkin].

Bands That Were Almost Were
---------------------------

The bands that we nearly had here, and didn't come for some reason.

Pink Floyd
~ (Or at least two of them) offered to play Derwent barbie for free.

Blur
~ Were turned down for Derwent barbecue, possibly by the SU.

Utah Saints
~ Were also turned down for DB (1993), but used to play Silks in town.

Sisters of Mercy
~ The Sisters wanted to play their 10th anniversary gig here but were
  told to get lost by the SU in a stunning piece of shortsightedness.

Inspiral Carpets
~ Were advertised for the Alcuin Freshers' Gig, 1989.

Julia Fordham
~ Was booked to play Central Hall during her Autumn tour in 1989. The
  gig was cancelled, according to the woman herself (during a later
  concert at the Barbican), because she was going to the toilet on the
  touoru coach when the ironing board fell down and knocked her
  out. She wasn't really up to doing the concert after that.

U2
~ Advertised to appear at 1981 Vanbrugh freshers ball, as far as we
  know they didn't.

Public Enemy
~ American Rap band - wanted to come during 1990, but were turned down
  by the S.U. due to lack of a venue.

ELP
~ Were supposed to be booked for Freshers Week in '71 but they bailed
  out and we got Coliseum instead.
