The water tower on Siward's Howe (the thing that looks like a castle)
has been there since 1955. It was built to serve the rapidly expanding
population of York at that time. The Fine Arts Commission had a say in
the design, following a great deal of controversy, and the original
builders were bankrupted by the work which had to be completed by
another firm. The tower held one million gallons of water and was the
largest elevated tank in the country when built. In 1977 a ten million
gallon covered reservoir was constructed alongside it to supplement
the supply. (Source:Heslington - a Portrait of the Village, Alfred
Colley.)

The tower is no longer used for water, as [Pete Simpson][] tells us:

14/4/2002. Robert Gipson got in touch with the following:

And then again, after further research, Robert uncovered this:

> Siward , d. 1055, earl of Northumbria. A Danish warrior, he probably
> came to England with King Canute. At the behest of King Harthacanute
> in 1041 he ravaged Worcestershire and perhaps murdered Eadwulf of
> Northumbria; thereafter he was himself earl of Northumbria. He
> supported Edward the Confessor against Earl Godwin in 1051 and in
> 1054 defeated Macbeth, king of Scotland, on behalf of Siward's
> nephew, later Malcolm III.
>
> It appears I may be wrong re: the Roman connection. Them I`m no
> histrorian ! If he is the one, then I am wondering what the
> connection is to Siwards How near the uni !
