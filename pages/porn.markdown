On 18 August 1996, someone changed the content of the University
Conservative Society's web pages. This appeared in the Times, and
possibly a few other papers. The Times article also appeared in the
online Times Newspaper. This article hot off the press from the Week 0
issue of Vision (October 1996):

> THE UNIVERSITY is continuing its investigation into the placing of
> obscene remarks and pornographic images on York University's
> Conservative and Unionist Association's official web page over the
> summer.
>
> The offensive material was broadcast worldwide under the
> Conservative logo until Computer Services at the University became
> aware of the situation and immediately blocked the pages. The
> culprit substituted pictures of Margaret Thatcher and Michael
> Portillo with those of naked females and gay porn under such
> captions as "John Major's Favourite Pictures". Accounts of society
> meetings were altered to include calls from Mussolini and Hitler,
> while details of the associations trip to the London conference were
> tampered with to suggest members visited sex shops and prostitutes.
>
> The University has ascertained that the alterations, which made the
> front page of the Sport and appeared in major newspapers such as the
> Times, occurred in the early hours of the morning on two terminals
> in Goodricke computer room.
>
> A spokesperson for the university, commented that Computer Services
> were also sure that these changes were not done by a "hacker" but by
> someone who had in some way acquired the password which is needed to
> alter a home-page. Although it is further assumed that it is not a
> member of the campus tory party itself as the comments were so
> detrimental to the society.
>
> Hilary Layton, at the University's Press and Publicity office, was
> anxious to point out that such offences do not only contravene the
> university's policy, but are also against the law and that staff and
> students can be prosecuted for broadcasting such material on the
> internet.
>
> Matthew Stallabrass, campus conservative chair, was summoned to
> Conservative Central Office in London as a result of the prank.
>
> John Purle, chair 1994/5, commented: "the story made it into more
> than one newspaper...it must have been press released and so was
> probably a pre-meditated job with a political motive."
>
> He further defended the society against accusations that security
> was lax, in light of the fact that the password had not been updated
> since March stating: "members have the password, as do their friends
> and so on. The campus conservatives are not a clique - we are an
> open society."
>
> The associations web-pages have previously come under fire for their
> content which has been accused of being homophonic and sexist but
> these allegations have been fiercely denied and are not in any way
> connected with the current incident.
