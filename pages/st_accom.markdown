York was planned and built as a Collegiate University, with all
colleges close together on the main campus. These are covered in their
own document. There were also plans from the beginning for a
substantial amount of accommodation around Heslington, some of which
came to be built. In recent years many additional properties have been
converted to student rooms under the Living Over The Shop scheme.

St Lawrence Court
-----------------

St Lawrence consists of short terraces of houses, each with 10
study-bedrooms on three storeys. The houses are designed for
self-catering, each having a large kitchen. There are 26 houses in
all, labelled A-Z. St Lawrence was built after Eden's Court, at the
start of the 70's.

At first students were mostly undergraduates with some
postgraduates. Following the expansion of James College and it's
change to an undergraduate intake, St Lawrence was promised
exclusively to postgraduates, the transition starting in 1994. In
practice, undergraduates still live there, due partly to lack of space
elsewhere.

Unlike the old colleges, there is no 24-hour portering at St Lawrence,
and there is no bar or canteen. The only central facilities are a
common room and laundry.

The University is keen to let out houses to holiday-makers over the
summer. (Your editor was there during summer 1996 and didn't see a
single one let, but it could be argued that he keeps rather different
hours to most holiday-makers.)

Eden's Court
------------

Between St Lawrence Court and the campus. Self-catering accomodation
in the form of 8 houses each with 10 single rooms for undergraduates.

Eden's Court was the first of the developments near Heslington, and
was developed by the Design Unit, attatched to the Institute of
Advanced Architectural Studies. It was built at the start of the 70's.

Halifax Court
-------------

Due to be finished for the start of the 1996/7 academic year, but
delayed by conflicts with local residents and contractors going
bust. Halifax Court is now expected to open after Christmas 1996. It
is built in the same style as the extensions of Alcuin, and Derwith.

Halifax Court will accomodate about 450 students, in houses of 10-12
students each, by the time it is finished. The plan is to phase
construction over three years. Phase one should include a student
shop, common room etc.

Bleachfield
-----------

A group of houses on campus, next to IRISS and the Music
Department. Houses 83 graduates, in a mix of single and double
study-bedrooms. Kitchens are provided. The buildings date from 1968.

Bleachfield has a number of much-sought-after garages to rent.

There is also a traditional cast-iron red phone box at one end of the
buildings.

Catherine House
---------------

An unremarkable building, housing 26 graduates in single rooms. Next
to Garrow House, access from campus is either along Retreat Lane and
sharp left, or cut through the Tuke Centre off University Road.

Constantine House
-----------------

In York, handy for King's Manor and a listed building into the
bargain. Constantine is home to 28 graduates, in single or double
rooms.

One of the first buildings to be aquired by the University after it
was founded in 1963.

The Hostel
----------

Next to the Retreat (may have been part of it at one point?), and
accomodating 20 students in 18 single rooms and a double.

Pete Fenelon reported that

Fairfax House
-------------

A large and impressive house, Fairfax stands on Heslington Road on the
way towards the Barbican from campus. Not to be confused with the
equally large and impressive Farfax House in the city centre, which is
a museum now. 93 undergraduates have single rooms there, and get
breakfast provided for them each morning.

During summer, Fairfax house is let as bed-and-breakfast accomodation
by the University.

Garrow House
------------

The `period mansion' (translation: big old house) of Garrow House has
been converted into accomodation for 28 students, 26 in single rooms
and the other two in a double. Facilities are quite good, and some of
the rooms are huge.

The house was built in the early 19th century.

Has a darkroom.

Holgate's Hall
--------------

A large house in Holgate, with 39 single rooms, 5 double rooms and 2
flats. Reserved for undergraduates.

PRS
---

Not a building, but included here for completeness. The University run
the Property Rental Scheme, whereby they act as agents and guarantors
to private landlords who own houses in town. Over 100 houses are let
in this way, with each house having 2-6 students in it.
