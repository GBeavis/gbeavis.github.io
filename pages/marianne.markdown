Well up on any list of `people we've heard of who once played York'
must be Marianne Faithful.

Issue 7 of Nouse contained the news that she was to be the star
attraction at the June Ball, to be held on Thursday June 17th at
King's Manor. Here are some quotes from Nouse No. 9 (24th June 1965):

> June Ball attendance was 500-550, of which 300 were students.

> Marianne Faithful delighted especially the male audience...

> Despite 30 minutes of non-stop singing and some 20 minutes spent
> signing autographs, she showed no desire to leave the dancers in the
> marquee.
