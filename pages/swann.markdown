Lord Swann was a distinguished member of the University of York,
Chancellor for many years. The following tribute was carried by the
*University Review 1989-90*:

> ### Lord Swann
>
> Lord Michael Swann FRS, Chancellor of the University since 1979,
> died on 22 September 1990.
>
> Michael Swann was born on 1 March 1920. He was an exhibitioner at
> Winchester where he was taught chemistry by Lord James, our first
> vice-chancellor. he went up to his father's college, Gonville &
> Caius, and after the war was elected to a Fellowship there
> in 1946. Sic years later he was appointed to the Chair of Natural
> History at Edinburgh University and in 1962 became a Fellow of the
> Royal Society. His main interest as a research biologist was in cell
> physiology and in particular fertilisation, mitosis and cell
> division - nearly all the work being done on the eggs of
> sea-urchins. After a spell as Dean of the Faculty of Science, he
> served an eight-year term as Principal and Vice-Chancellor of the
> University of Edinburgh. This was a time of rapid expansion and
> though the appointment of another scientist caused open resentment
> in some quarters, Michael rapidly gained the confidence of the
> University as a whole because of the firm, judicious and courteous
> way in which he conducted policy-making internally and the obviously
> beneficial influence his powerful presence had upon the University's
> reputation in the outside world. It was, however, also a time of
> serious student troubles and of difficulties over the Rectorship of
> the University which made meetings of the Court particularly
> wearisome. Unfortunately Michael allowed himself to become unduly
> emotionally involved in these affairs, many of which were deeply
> offensive to one of his sensitive nature, and he yearned for change.
>
> The offer of the Chairmanship of the MMC came just at the right
> time. From all accounts he was very successful there. his big,
> genial presence fitted in well with the atmosphere that permeated
> the Corporation. He enjoyed the job immensely; and probably his most
> important legacy for the future was the protection he established
> for the BBC against outside influences that threatened its
> independence.
>
> During the 'eighties he undertook many public duties of which
> perhaps the best known and certainly most difficult was his
> assumption, at a point of disorder and deadlock, of the Chairmanship
> of the Committee on the Education of Children from Ethnic
> Minorities. In the House of Lords he sat on the cross-benches and
> worked tirelessly in support of higher education. It was a hard,
> tedious slog, calling for considerable research and long sittings;
> and the result was the alteration of a few clauses that the
> Government felt it unwise to overturn. In one sense it was a poor
> reward, but it was precious for all that.
>
> He was an excellent Chancellor. his presence on Degree Day added
> much to the dignity of the occasion. He never sought to interfere in
> policy matters but gave excellent advice when asked and always
> wanted to be kept up to date with what was happening. Just now and
> again he was able to put a word for us in high places when the need
> seemed pressing.
>
> I knew him well for over twenty years. It was fun to be with him,
> for he was a great talker, a man of wide interests and a lover of
> gossip blessed with a wicked sense of humour. I find it hard to look
> at his photograph and realise that in future I will only be able to
> enjoy the memory of all that. The University, too, is the poorer for
> his early, wholly unexpected death.
