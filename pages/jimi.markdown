including such venues as

More information comes from [Steve Rodham][]

Your investigative team reply:
------------------------------

The Campus Archives in this case consist solely of back issues of the
Campus Newspaper Nouse. This is very quiet on the event, leading us to
suspect that there might be an issue missing from the archive in the
library, which may have had a review. What we do have is the following
advert in the previous paper: (Feb 16th 1967)

> Rave Reviews have followed\
> Jimi Hendrix\
> Throughout His Short Career\
> See Why\
> in\
> Langwith College\
> Saturday 18th February\
> with\
> T D Backus & the Powerhouse\
> and\
> The Peeps

It was a quarter page advert, no graphics or pictures just the text
with a box round it. Admission was apparently 6/-.

There is a small and badly printed photo of Hendrix in the next paper,
but no indication of where and when it was taken!
