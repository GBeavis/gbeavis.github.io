title: Student Occupations at York
---

(More details to be added, sometime.)

1960's: Heslington Hall
-----------------------

Students campaigning for something or other occupied Hes Hall on at
least two occasions, possibly including an ``Open the Files''
occupation in 1969.

1970: Heslington Hall
---------------------

On March 3rd there was a General Meeting, at which it was voted to
occupy Hes Hall. The students were compaigning over rights of access
to confidential files alledgedly containing details of political and
other activities by students. About 60 people occupied Heslington Hall
overnight. (No details about how it ended yet.)

Late 1970's: Library
--------------------

Students held a ``work-in'' overnight, as part of a protest about
grants.

1978 or 1979: Heslington Hall
-----------------------------

Just before finals, Heslington Hall was occupied by students. Andy
Champ spoke against the occupation at a Union Meeting and was quoted
in Nouse, but they called him ``Andy Capp''. In those days, the quorum
for a UGM was 10% of not very many people, so a smallish number of
people could swing a vote fairly easily. At the next meeting about a
thousand people turned up and voted to end the occupation.

1982/3: Heslington Hall
-----------------------

An article about this was apparently in Vision a few years ago.

1988: Heslington Hall
---------------------

No details at present.

1993: Central Hall
------------------

Some of this is from memory for the time being. GRS

The occupations of Central hall were in December 1993 (Can't remember
what it was for. Possibly the grant cuts). Only a small number of
students took part, but they received messages of support from other
SUs, and even the peace campaigners from Menwith Hill. The vice
chancellor agreed with the demonstrating students' point (but not the
occupation).

There were at least two occupations of Central Hall, following a
failed attempt to occupy Heslington Hall (staff locked the door and
refused admission). The first took place on Sunday, when it was
unused, and the students were chucked out when admin wanted to use it
next day. Legend has it that they sent the SU a portering bill, there
was certainly some financial penalty involved.

The second occupation, a few days later, was a bit less tame. In the
end, there was an incident involving Bishwa B. Bandhari breaking a
window (Apparently he didn't do it, but he didn't deny having done it
when he was accused of it. For the publicity apparently.) There was
also a claim of injury inflicted by a security guard or porter. Bishwa
was I think given a suspended sentence by the University, if he had
been kicked out then he would have been deported.
