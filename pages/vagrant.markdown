From the September 1995 *Grapevine*, who got it from the June 1995
*Nouse*:

> A vagrant who had made his home in a college bathroom has been the
> subject of a number of police call-outs this term, including a cross
> campus chase with a police dog after residents of Langwith C block
> realised they could not allow him to stay.
>
> On one occasion the cleaners arriving in the morning were forced to
> open a bathroom door from the outside. Its inhabitant, who had been
> asleep in the bath, was chased away from the building by a cleaning
> lady wielding a mop.

The fitting of locks to all external college doors should make this
incident a thing of the past.
