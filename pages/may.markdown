The arrival of the Mayflower (the sculpture which once stood outside
Central Hall, and looked like a crisp) was documented by the
University News Sheet, issue 211, March 1990.

> ### Mayflower Arrives
>
> Mayflower 1, by local sculptor Michael Lyons has recently appeared
> next to Central Hall. Made of steel the sculpture was constructed in
> conjunction with Mayflower Engineering of Sheffield. The simple
> form, heightened by applied colour, is intended to hold its own in a
> large open space. Mayflower is on permanent loan, subject to an
> annual review.
>
> Michael Lyons lives in Cawood, near Selby, and studied sculpture at
> Wolverhampton College of Art and the University of Newcastle. He is
> Head of the MA course in Fine Art at Manchester Polytechnic and a
> founder member of the Yorkshire Sculpture Park.
>
> In recent years he has concentrated mainly on steel for large works
> and bronze for small pieces. Some recent sculptures have been too
> big for his studio and he has begun to liaise with local industry,
> working alongside engineers and fabricators, in carrying out his
> ideas.
>
> He has work sited in both rural and urban settings throughout the
> country and the region.

Mayflower I was graffittied once or twice, and sadly was removed from
campus. We have some pictures of the sculpture with graffitti and
being cleaned.

The sculpture has now been retired to a quiet garden in Cawood, near
the church.
