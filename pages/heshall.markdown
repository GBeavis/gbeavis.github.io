This is just a quick guide to the history of Heslington Hall, for more
details you can get a copy of the leaflet ``Heslington Hall,
Introductory notes on the building and its owners''. This is published
by the University of York printing unit, and is available free from
Hes. Hall reception.

Although Heslington Hall dates from about 1565, most of the present
building was built in the 19th century. The hall was originally
completed about 1568 for Thomas Eynns, Secretary and Keeper of the
Seal to the Council of the North.

It was rebuilt in 1852-5 for the owner, Yarburgh Greame. The architect
on this work was P.C. Hardwick, who designed the Great Hall at Euston
station. The staircase towers are among remains of the original
house). The building and grounds were much admired, appearing in
Country Life 1900 and 1909 (in City Reference Library, Yorkshire
Room).

The Yew alleys in the gardens of Heslington Hall were first planted in
about 1720. The bushes used to be pruned to the shape of chesspieces
back in Victorian times. The sunken area near the modern lake used to
be a mirror pond, reflecting the gazebo.

During the Second World War, Heslington Hall became the headquarters
of 4 Group, Bomber Command.

By the 1960's the hall was derelict. The University took over the
building as it's headquarters in 1962.
