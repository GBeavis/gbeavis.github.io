Since the dawn of University time, there have been complaints about
the quality of the water in the lake. This article comes from Nouse,
Thurs, May 11th 1967.

> ### Lake Health Hazard?
>
> The obnoxious smell rising from the lake at various times,
> particularly around the Derwent watercourt area, is purely the
> result of stagnation and not because of waste materials getting into
> the water, Mr. McMeeking assured Nouse this week.
>
> The stagnation results from a very slow and limited supply of water
> from a small stream that flows under the new road. The process of
> eradicating the dead weed is predominately ecological and the
> operation is being conducted in full consultation with Dr Alan
> Winter of the biology department. Weed killers will also be used.
>
> Mr McKeeking said ``We hope to have the trouble cleared up by the
> end of the Summer.''
