Why is V/058 called vuft?
-------------------------

Contraction of
vee-oh-five-eight.... v'oh-fv'ght... v'hf't... vuft. See? Simple.

Where did the spare DECWRITER come from?
----------------------------------------

Once upon a time, there was a DECWRITER III in Vuft. It sat there,
quite contentedly, minding its own business, never for one moment
suspecting the dreadful events that were about to unfold.

Late one night - in the middle of the Team Software Project, in 1994,
there were three compscis who could no longer face working
(footnote). One of them proclaimed to the others:

``Lo! It is said that in Wentworth, the infidels have cast a DECWRITER
into the wilderness, that it might perish or be collected by the
bin-men! Can we, true believers all, allow this to happen?''

``Nay!'' was the righteous reply, and Lo! they did set forth to save
the decwriter, for such is the True Way of The CompSci.

The valiant trio did trek across campus, verily unto the portals of
distant Wentworth college itself, and there, amidst the debris and
rubbish, they did find the lone DECWRITER, scorned and abandoned,
awaiting salvation.

By dint of much effort, the three did carry the DECWRITER, with much
agony, and many stops - for a DECWRITER is a heavy load, even for the
righteous. Eventually, the haven of Vuft did appear before them,
welcoming them with its softly glowing emergency lights, and the smell
like a wumpus' armpit in summer.

When the DECWRITER was finally placed within the confines of the inner
sanctum itself, the devoted trinity did rest heavily upon their
laurels, and declare that Lo! It was not enough to restore the
DECWRITER to civilisation, but more should be done! It should be given
life!

The junior of the trio was sent forth for a screwdriver set, and the
said item was retrieved.

`` But where shall we get a plug?'' they did wail, until it was
decided that to save the new DECWRITER, the old must sacrifice its
plug, that the new might live.

The plug was duly removed, with much wailing and gnashing of teeth,
and placed, fully upon the new DECWRITER, for all that it was battered
and water damaged. Finally, the DECWRITER was plugged in, and the
printer did spring into life! Fully one and a half lines of test
printing did burst joyfully forth from the head of the printer, before
tragedy struck, and the printer breathed its last, nevermore to work
again, for its fuse had been blown by its ordeal.

``But where shall we get a new fuse?'' they did wail, until it was
decided once more, that to save the new DECWRITER, the old must be
sacrificed. But calamity! The DECWRITERS were not of the same species,
and they could not share fuses as they had shared plugs!

Thus the DECWRITER of old was repaired - its plug returned and its
fuse replaced, and yet it did not work! Lo, a tragedy had ensued! In
seeking to add to their printers, the hapless compsci's had deprived
themselves of their sole, prized DECWRITER... ... and the decision was
made, that only the techies could save the printer now, and the matter
was left unto their hands...

When the morning came, and the techie did arrive, he did look to the
original DECWRITER, and moved in mysterious ways - as is his wont -
and Lo! It did spring to life once more! A miracle! He saw the
printer, and saw that it was good. He checked the paper, and saw that
it was plentiful. He turned, and beheld that the DECWRITER had spawned
a child, (Footnote1) and saw that it was mightily confusing. He fled
rapidly, and did return with another techie, who saw the second
DECWRITER, and did declare it mightily confusing.

In the corner, the three compscis, deprived of sleep, and odd of mood,
did verily piss themselves laughing at such a sight - but the
spectacle had not finished... for the techies did return with a
trolley, and load the DECWRITER that it might be transported away. A
ransom note was left in its place, reading only:

``If you have lost a decwriter, it is in A block.''

And thus the parable of the DECWRITER ends, with the second DECWRITER
sitting, to this day, in A-Block.

Footnote: Even the compsci who wasn't even doing the Team Software
Project that year, but had nothing more worthwhile to do.

Footnote1: This is a great feat of observation for an average techie,
who takes over six months to notice a `damaged' Blackboard.

What is traditional behaviour during projects?
----------------------------------------------

In days of yore, when the real compsci stalked the land, vuft was more
exciting. Before any hand-in and during the team software project,
vuft would become crowded. Perhaps surprisingly, this in itself
doesn't encourage bad behaviour. It's when the regulars are left alone
at night that things get out of hand.

Apart from the obvious sleep deprivation, there are four main
traditions:

1. Aussie monitors.

   Orbit, the sad gimp's operating system of choice, is
   monochrome. Anything to add colour to the gimp's life is like manna
   from heaven. There's a colourful effect that can be produced on the
   monitors in vuft. It involves standing a monitor on its head and
   then pressing the de-Gauss button before righting the monitor
   again.

   This causes a purple infusion from the corners of the
   display. Highly amusing. But only if you've been awake for three
   days...

2. Fire! Fire! Fire!

   Everyone likes to burn things. Compscis like to burn each
   other. Vuft is the perfect place to start a fire. There are no
   smoke detectors, and there's lots of paper. You just need to supply
   the matches.

   The other good thing about vuft is that it contains a fire
   extinguisher, but we've never had occasion to use it.

3. Vuft cricket

4. Breakfast

Where can you buy breakfast after number 3?
-------------------------------------------

After a hard night's hacking^H^H^H^H^H^H^H software engineering,
you'll need breakfast. But where is breakfast to be found on campus
early in the morning? In our experience, Langwith is the place to
go. This contrasts sharply with the rest of the day, when Langwith is
a place to avoid.

Sadly, despite the underlying principles of software engineering, and
the Team Software Project, they do not serve quiche at this hour.

Quiche: the staple food of software engineers, along with the
ubiquitous mince.

Blackboard
----------

N.b. all names in this anecdote have been changed, to protect the
innocent, the not-so-innocent, and the downright guilty.

Once upon a time, there was a blackboard in vuft. During the annual
torture known simply as CTS, there was a compsci - we'll call him
simply `James' - asleep on the ample space beneath the blackboard, in
an effort to regain enough coherence to be able to add anything
worthwhile to his report.

Another compsci - we'll call him `Steve' - thought it would be a jolly
jape to throw a solid object at the blackboard to rapidly wake
`James', sleeping beneath it. The first such object that came to
mind - and sadly, to hand - was a mouseball. After all, this
inoffensive little item is made from rubber, isn't it? I know it's
very heavy and all that, but rubber is heavy, isn't it?

Taking this somewhat weighty projectile in hand, `Steve' proceeded to
throw it at the blackboard... The result, somewhat obviously, in
hindsight, was a loud crackling smashing noise, followed by the soft
tinkling of shards of glass falling onto the table, the floor, and the
unfortunate `James'.

`James's reaction was simply to pick fragments of glass from his face,
and return to sleep, while the assembled compscis watched in horror as
the blackboard - now revealed to be made from a sheet of thick glass,
painted black - cracked across the middle, leaving a somewhat
distinctive star-shaped shatter mark.

And so it was, for several months - each morning the techies would
arrive as usual, check that each machine still had a keyboard, check
that the printer hadn't spawned again. (See the section on the
decwriter for details).

And not once did they notice that the blackboard was severely
damaged - to a dangerous degree, with the compscis continually poking
and prodding at it, until the backing panel could be seen, what with
shards of the blackboard being removed...

Eventually, some months later, realisation dawned, when they realised
that the blackboard shouldn't really have a crack running from bottom
to top, and from side to side - not to mention the gaping wound in the
middle, with brown backing showing through. **Something had to be
done!**

They immediately declared that the two PCs beneath the board were
unsafe, warned everyone not to use them, and hurried off for some
brightly coloured tape, which they proceeded to tie at suitable points
around the board to stop people getting too close.

Naturally people quickly moved to sit inside the cordoned off area.

The excess tape - bright orange, almost luminous - was left neatly
coiled bennneath the table, out of harms reach... until the compscis
sliced it off, and cut it into useable lengths. For example, one
compsci, known here for anonymity's sake as `MAD', fashioned himself a
headband, marked in typical samurai style.

What connection is there between the University and the Canadian police?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the words of Dave Snowden:

> Someone at internic.net has screwed up the reverse lookup entries
> for the University subnet (144.32). In fact they have managed to
> overwrite our entry by one for the York Regional Police in Ontario!
>
> This change occurred on 25 January, and as our entries expire from
> the caches on other domain name servers we are finding that some
> sites are refusing to accept mail and FTP connections from our
> machines.
>
> They are working to fix the problem, and then it will take a little
> time for the corrected details to propagate.

What does `ubiquitous' mean?
----------------------------

According to the online dictionary, ubiquitous means:

> turf vb : to cover with turf

Another interesting dictionary entry is that for the word `occasion':

> 'occasion' not found. Perhaps you meant:
>
> 1. occasion

Such befuddlements, especially when the reader is in the throes of the
Team Software Project can lead to great agitation, and eventually, to
nervous breakdowns.

Why do the vuft PCs start at number 7?
--------------------------------------

A boring answer, this. As we all know, the vuft PCs' numbers are
related to their addresses. Thus PC 31 is 144.32.192.131. The numbers
up to 106 were used by staff machines, so student machines had to
start at 107. Thus, PC 7.

Why is the question about the number 7, number 8?

If you need to ask what a [Wumpus] is, then it is probably for the
best that you remain in blissful ignorance. With the emphasis on
blissful...
