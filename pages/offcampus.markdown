Micklegate House
----------------

Micklegate House stands at 88-90 Micklegate, near the centre of the
city. It was the original home of the Music Department, before they
moved onto campus and their own buildings.

The house was built by the noted architect John Carr (a York lad
himself) in 1753. It was commissioned for the Bourchier family of
Beningbrough.

The University felt it no longer had a need for the building when
(Archaeology?) moved out in the early 90's, and put the building up
for sale, but no buyer was found and it remains in University hands.

St John the Evangelist
----------------------

The church of St John the Evangelist, in Mickelgate, was built c.1194
and much altered in later years. It closed in 1934, but was restored
in 1956 by the York Civic Trust for the Institiute of Advanced
Architectural Studies (a forerunner of the University.) It has since
been further converted into York Arts Centre.

St Anthony's Hall
-----------------

St Anthony's Hall stands in Peasholme Green, and is occupied by the
Borthwick Institute for Historical Research - part of the University.

The Hall was built in c.1453 for the social and religious guild of St
Anthony. It was extended many times, notably during the late 15th
century, and during 1655-6 when the timber upper storey was
replaced. In the 17th century it became a house of correction, and in
the 18th century a school. The Institute moved in during the 1950's.
