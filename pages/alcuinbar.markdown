Alcuin bar changed dramatically in the Summer of 1995.

> The mid-90s revamp of Alcuin Bar wasn't the only one. It had

> refurbishment the games area was to the left of the main entrance,
> the bar area was mostly decorated in rather shabby
> green/orange/brown. The games/darts area ('87-95) was formerly a
> small, quiet and (usually!) chilly room known to its denizens (it
> was the sort of place that had denizens rather than customers) as
> ``the office''.

> Jean and Sandra used to pull the best pints on campus, and

> Alcuin cared about its customers. In his first year, Graham Taylor

> Alcuin Bar. He was much addicted to a particular Star Trek game that
> had a predominantly blue screen, and you could see the colour go out
> when he'd finished. It got to the point where his first pint of
> cider was always being pulled when he was on his way over the
> Alcuin/Langwith bridge!
