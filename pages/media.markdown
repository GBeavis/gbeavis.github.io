**Includes a list of what we have in S020's library. We would welcome
  any donations to fill the gaps.**

Just to be tedious, each year has a little dot next to it. This is
what the dots mean:

Eboracum
--------

The original campus media. No copies known to survive. Thought to be a
bit arty. (Please feel free to prove me wrong on this one. GRS)

Nouse
-----

The original independant student newspaper, first issue published 23
Nov 1964, and still going, more or less. Publication frequency has
varied, but is typically fortnightly during term time only. There is
an incomplete set of back issues in the Special Collections section of
the JBM library.

Vision
------

Started in 1987 as a rival to Nouse, usually published fortnightly
during term time only (the alternate week to Nouse). There is an
incomplete set of back issues in the Special Collections section of
the JBM library.

University Magazine
-------------------

Successor to the *News Sheet*, it is believed to have been launched
along with the University's new Corporate Image in 1993. Publication
is monthly, and the issue numbering followed on from the News Sheet
apart from December 1995 - March 1996, when they started at 600 in
honour of the 600th Anniversary of the City of York.

The Magazine has a [web page on YorkWeb][magazine].
