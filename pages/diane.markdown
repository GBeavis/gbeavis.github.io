title: Diana Statue Incident
---

As mentioned in the York Campus Folklore, there used to be a statue
called `Diana the Huntress' standing on the lawn in front of
Heslington Hall.

After the first Physics Department Christmas Dinner, (12th Dec 1965)
the members of the department and friends returned to campus, somewhat
jolly, and began carol singing on the lawn in the Heslington Hall
courtyard. The self appointed conductor, a member of the Chemistry
department, climbed up onto the plinth of the statue of Diana. Upon
seeing the porter coming to send them away, said chap launched off of
the plinth, sending the statue in the other direction, to break in
pieces on the ground.

The events which followed are somewhat unclear, but many of the
participants escaped. One however (a second year economist) was
cornered by a porter, and then unwisely decided to fight his way
out. The police were called, and he was jailed for assault.

Following enquiries (including the questioning of the rugby team, who
had nothing to do with it but were obvious suspects in the eyes of the
authorities) those who were caught were fined for the repair.

It seems that the GSA spent it's share of the fine on setting up a bar
for their members.
