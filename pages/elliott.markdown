**The first computer at York was an Elliott 4130, delivered
  in 1967. The full story is in the Computation Department Page. Here
  is some information about the company and their computers.**

History
-------

Elliott was one of the early British computer makers, but were an
early victim of mergers into larger companies. This is a brief guide
to the company.

The company was formed in London in 1801, making scientific apparatus,
with the name Elliott Brothers. The company diversified into control
systems and during the second world war they established a research
lab at Borehamwood, carrying out development work for the Navy. By the
early 1950's they had a staff of 450. It was here that their first
computers were built, following from the work on real-time digital
control for Navy guns.

The first production machines were the 400 series, starting in 1955,
and Elliott subsequently developed the 800 series, forerunner to many
of the world's computer designs. The first 802 machine was delivered
in 1952, it's successor the 803 was widely used. (The PDP/8 did not
arrive until 1965, and 803's outnumbered them until 1969.) Elliott
were untouched by merger wave of 1960-3, which left just 3 UK computer
manufacturers: International Computers and Tabulators Ltd., English
Electric and Elliott-Automation. However, with severe budget problems,
they were taken over by English Electric in 1967. A few months later,
I.C.T. and the data processing departments of E.E. merged to form
I.C.L.

**Evolution of ICL, from a Computer Conservation Society newsletter.**

It may be a bit more complicated than that - it seems the company was
split between ICT and Marconi in 1967. ITC got the data processing
side, and Marconi got the process control side.

The Elliott factory at Borehamwood is now part of GEC Marconi. Andrew
Gabriel has a [web page covering GEC history][gec] on another site.

ICL are of course still in business, and their advertising includes
references to Elliott. (See the poster in P/S020 for example.)

Computers
---------

The [Comprehensive Computer Catalogue][catalogue] lists 22 models made
by Elliott, starting with the 152 in 1947 and going through to the
l920M of 1967.

Two notable models are the 401 (1953) and 803 (1961), examples of
which have been preserved by the Science Museum and Computer
Conservation Society.

The 4130 (the model installed at York) dates from July 1966. and was a
development of the model 4120 (April 1965). The machines were often
known as the Elliott/NCR 4100 series (Elliott and NCR had a cross
marketing agreement) and also for a time as the ICL 4100 series. Both
machines had 24 bit words, instructions were 12 or 24 bits, the 4130
had hardware floating point operations, the 4120 had software
emulation. The 4130 may also have had extra instructions/hardware to
support multi-programming.

The [Computer Conservation Society][society] has an emulator for the
Elliot 903. In fact, it is just an implementation of the Elliott
Algol-system, allbeit a nice one. A point of interest is that the
original Elliott Algol compiler was co-written by C.A.R. (Tony) Hoare,
who, together with Edsger Dijkstra and Niklaus Wirth, invented
structured programming.

Appendix: Elliott card readers

This item from a news posting by Ed Thelen that seemed too good to
edit out.

> A little arm pushed the card on the 80 column edge past 12 photo
