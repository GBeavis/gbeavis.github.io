> ### Students Break TV Record
>
> Students at York are recovering from a mammoth event which broke the
> world record for the longest television programme directed by one
> person. For 28 hours and 1 minute, York Student Television (YSTV)
> broadcast live to its monitors on the University's cable network.
>
> The programme, called Breaker 88, featured both contemporary and
> classical music, a complete game-show competition, pool and dart, a
> cabaret and magic show and countless interviews.
>
> Programme director was Keith Hide-Smith, a third-year Computer
> Science student.
>
> During the programme, Keith was allowed only 5 minutes break every
> hour. ``Staying awake wasn't a big problem,'' he commented. The
> adrenaline and cups of black coffee kept me going.''

> hundred pounds were raised for the RNLI, Cancer Research, NSPCC and
> a local community fund.

> ``Breaker 88 is very much a one-off,'' said Malcolm Heath, Station
> Director. ``YSTV's next project is coverage of the Students' Union
> Elections in March.''
