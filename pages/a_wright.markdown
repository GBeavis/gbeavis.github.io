The link between these sculptures is local artist Austin
Wright. Well-known throught the country, many of his works have been
exhibited on the Heslington campus, and at King's Manor. Austin was
also an honorary graduate of the University. He died in early 1997.

The sculptures which may have all got thrown in the lake (see the
folklore page) were his, for instance.

There was also a display at King's Manor a couple of years ago. The
exhibition was not welcomed by all - within days of all these large
aluminium things arriving, along came a film crew to do some stuff for
the kids' TV show "How We Used To Live" - there had been some bookings
cock-up, so the camera people had to be very careful whilst shooting
their olde worlde stuff (with nylon lawn and plasic picket fence) not
to get all these bizarre metal things in shot. They were not happy.

Dryad
-----

This sculpture stands outside Heslington Hall, in front of the Yew
garden. (There used to be a Henry Moore there.) The central university
web archive has a picture of it - click on the thumbnail below.

Tears of St Lawrence
--------------------

The Tears stand on top of the St Lawrence Court common room.

`Library Sculpture'
-------------------

This is the metal structure in the centre of the spiral up to the
library bridge. It has been called the `Avocado' and the
`Orange'. When an inventory was being compiled in 1992, Mr Wright was
phoned on the subject of the name. He said it didn't have a name and
`Library Sculpture' was as good as anything.

The metalwork is made of aluminum.

The Three Norns
---------------

Now on loan to King's Manor following a the above-mentioned exhibition
of his work there.
