Development of the University
-----------------------------

At the start of the 1960's, the government announced plans for a huge
increase in the number of university places available. New
universities were to be built, many on green-field sites, which were
to provide the best possible environment for teaching and
research. York was one of these new universities.

Officers of the University, architects and engineers, and the
Promotion committee were all chosen, and were given the task of
planning a university from scratch, to be built as quickly as
possible. They were:

The site chosen was towards the south-east of the city, between
Walmgate stray and the farming village of Heslington (pop. 800). A
total of 180 acres was purchased, including the derelict Heslington
Hall with its grounds and lake, and some land from the Retreat
hospital. The site was entirely outside the city boundary.

Much of the site was fairly boggy, with ground water over large
areas. Basements to buildings were avoided for this reason. The
proposed solution to the drainage problem was a substantial number of
drainage pipes, feeding into a lake to be excavated in the centre of
the site. Material from the excavation would be used to build up the
surrounding areas slightly.

The existing road, from Heslington village past Bleachfield House (now
demolished) and the Retreat hospital, was replaced by a new road,
running to the north of the old one and joining Hull Road in a
different place. The road was designed to be cut into the bankside to
reduce it's obtrusiveness, and curved to reduce traffic speeds. As
built, the cutting was restricted by cost cuts, and the road was
straightened at the insistence of the local road safety officer.

It was realised that the university could not all be built at one
time, and students would be admitted whilst the building was still
going on. The plans allowed for this by starting at the Heslington
Hall end of the site and progressively developing towards the town
end, maintaining a division between the occupied parts of the site and
those still under construction. As part of this plan, and to enable
work to be readily broken down into units which could be accomplished
when the finances permitted, the total 10-year development plan was
broken down into four phases, each taking 2-3 years to complete.

Phase 1
~ The conversion of Heslington Hall and King's Manor into teaching
  accomodation. This would allow the admission of non-science
  undergraduates. Civil engineering: drainage to lake, and access
  roads. This work was carried out by conservation and conversion
  architect Bernard Feilden.

Phase 2
~ Building the first two colleges, and the first science block, to
  allow the admission of undergraduates in physics, biology and
  chemistry, and allow students to live on campus. The central boiler
  house also came under this phase, as did general site work such as
  building bridges. Central facilities of library and central assembly
  hall, and 6 non-science departmental buildings.

Phase 3
~ Another three colleges to be built, and the second science
  block. Another 9 non-science teaching blocks. Sports centre, concert
  hall and theatre to be constructed.

Phase 4
~ The final three colleges to be built, bringing the total to eight,
  and another 6 non-science departments. Also maybe the third science
  block, if not built at the end of Phase 3. New colleges to be
  somewhat larger than the old ones. Existing 5 colleges to have extra
  accomodation built to bring their size to that of VI-VII, to be
  based around a departmental building surplus to requirements.

An important part of the Plan was the creation of a park-like site for
the campus. The main element of this is obviously the lake, but much
effort also went in to landscaping and planting around it. The flora
on campus was planned by Maurice Lee.

The comparatively large amount of building to be done in a short time
lead the development committee to the use of prefabricated building
materials. This aspect is covered [elsewhere][buildings].

The development plan covers the academic brief in some detail. From
the outset it was established that there would have to be a broad
division in the provision of science and non-science courses, since
the science courses needed to have labs built which would take some
time. The original intention was to finish with a ratio of 40:60
science:non-science students.

The university was to make provision for undergraduate and
postgraduate study. It was felt important that courses were not too
narrow in their content, to avoid extreme specialisation. It was also
proposed from the outset not to teach law, teaching, or any
technological subjects.

The college structure was one of the central ideas behind the campus
design. All members of the University, staff and students, were to be
members of a college, which would facilitate the mixing of students
and staff of different subjects. The colleges would provide
residential accomodation, communal meals, leisure facilities, and
teaching accomodation. The development plan envisaged single-sex
colleges ``at least as far as undergraduates are concerned'', however
this idea was soon reversed by the academic members of the
committee. The size of the colleges was to be 300 members initially,
rising to 450 members at the most, this being roughly the number of
people who could get to know one another during three years at
university.

The plan included a large number of staff living on campus, part of
the desire to form a strong identity for the University. ``There
should be no rigid demarcation between the places where the members of
the University work and the places where they live and have their
homes, and there must be provision for residence within the University
complex for the maximum possible number of teachers, students and
staff of all kinds.''

Student numbers were designed to grow to about 3000 by the end of the
development period in 1972. 50% of undergraduates were to be housed on
campus. As well as the colleges, many smaller units of accomodation
were allowed for in the plan. There was to be accomodation for 950
undergraduates in flats, and 460 family houses for postgraduates and
staff. All of these were to be built on campus or around
Heslington. In the event, mixing large numbers of staff and students
on campus was not felt to be a good idea by either side, and the idea
was dropped.

Timetabling of lectures was to be carried out centrally to maximise
use of facilities. It was also intended to deliberately move students
around between lectures, to ``multiply the opportunities for random
contact and mixing between the different work and social groups within
the whole University''.

With everything on one campus, and movement between buildings
encouraged by the design and timetabling, much thought was given to
communications on the site. With road traffic confined to the edge of
the site, a network of pathways was planned to join all buildings, for
pedestrians, cycles in some cases, and trollies to move supplies from
the road access to various buildings. Many of these walkways were to
be built with canopies, to provide weather protection. The canopies
were also supposed to carry all services around the site - power,
water, communications etc. In the event, the engineers involved could
not agree on how to do it, and only phone and computer lines are
supported in this way.

It was decided for reasons of economy and reduction of pollution and
noise, that hot water and heating would be supplied from a central
boiler house, to be built away from residential blocks. The boilers
supplied high pressure hot water to the buildings around the campus,
where Calorifier stations would extract the energy for room heating
and hot water. (In more recent years, one of the original boilers has
been replaced by a combined heat and power unit, with a gas-powered
generator producing electricity and hot water.)

The campus was designed to be capable of easy expansion, both during
the initial development phases and in the long-term future. This
applied both to the campus as a whole, and to individual buildings on
it. For instance, the first science block to be built had to
accomodate Physics, Chemistry and Biology, with Physics and Biology
moving out in later years when their own buildings became
available. The science buildings had a large area left around them for
two reasons:

> 11.3\
> **Science Department**\
> (d)\
> Space for external growth and change is provided in the Development
> Plan adjacent to each of these units in the form of clear space of
> at least twice the unit area surrounded by a tree screen so that the
> scientists can carry on their unpredictable pursuits without
> nuisance to the rest of the University community, but equally
> without being shut away from it in undesirable isolation.

Plan of Campus
--------------

![Plan of Campus][]

The above illustration shows how the campus was expected to look
by 1970. The eight colleges are shown as white circles, and occupy the
positions expected. The large red circle marked `L' is the library, in
its original position above the road. The original idea was for
underground car parking, but the map shows large semi-circular car
park next to it. Three white circles marked `S1' - `S3' are the
science departments, in the order of construction - these are
Chemistry, Physics and Biology today. There are also four small red
circles, marked `H' (Central Hall), `S' (Sports Centre), `T' (Theatre)
and `C' (Concert Hall). The theatre has a large car park, and was
intended to be next to the lake. The Concert Hall seems well away from
anything else, sitting on the hill under the Siwards Howe water
tower. The boiler house is also marked, (`B' behind `S1'). The large
number of small squares shown on the map were intended to be staff
housing. The covered walkways are shown in yellow, whilst the outer
red circle is the distance walkable in 10 minutes.

The above notes have been produced with the aid of the recorded
lecture `The Architecture of the University of York' given by Andrew
Darbyshire in 1977.
