The University News Sheet for March 1992 reports that:

> ### Oak Kiosk Unveiled
>
> The Estates Department's Joiner's Shop was delighted when John
> Niklaus and Bill Burns gave us the task of building an oak-panelled
> telephone kiosk in the entrance to King's Manor.
>
> The whole of the construction was carried out in the University's
> workshop. The moulds and masons' mitres were skillfully reproduced
> as authentically as is practically possible, using good quality
> English oak which had been lying in the Joiner's timber store for
> many years. Alas, the same cannot be said of the panels, which,
> because of financial restraints, were made with American oak-faced
> plywood.
>
> The member of our joinery staff who was responsible for making and
> fixing the kiosk was John Hobson, under the watchful eye of our
> chargehand joiner Ken Whitehead.
>
> John, who joined the University from the Joseph Rowntree Trust in
> 1985, works mostly in the workshop and welcomed to opportunity to
> work down at King's Manor.
>
> The hoarding is now down and this fine improvement is there for
> staff, students and visitors to enjoy.
>
> Taking advantage of the disruption to the entrance area, the Estates
> Department's electrical staff have made radical improvements to the
> wiring, which is now concealed beneath new plasterwork.
>
> A job of this sort gives us a chance to show off now and again!
