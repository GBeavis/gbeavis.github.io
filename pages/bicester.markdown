> ### ``Eccentric'' peer seeks Lords role
> **By Paul Stokes**
>
> A Peer who has spent 31 years in psychiatric hospitals hopes to be
> allowed to sit in the House of Lords again.
>
> The 3rd Baron Bicester yesterday had his case referred to a
> tribunal. He claims that he has not been a danger to himself or
> others for 15 years. As the heir-presumptive to his title, he made
> news headlines in 1957 after spending a night in Wormwood Scrubs for
> being unable to pay £80 in fines.
>
> He had been convicted by a Bow Street magistrate of six charges of
> obtaining money by false pretences after presenting worthless
> cheques to restaurants.
>
> Lord Bicester, 64, an Old Etonian whose full name is Angus Edward
> Vivian Smith, has been detained in various hospitals since a
> psychiatric order was made in 1965. He is currently living in the
> Retreat Hospital, York.
>
> During the 1980s he was released briefly, when he is believed to
> have exercised his right to vote in Lords debates. He was returned
> to a psychiatric hospital after trying to flag down a car carrying
> the Princess of Wales in an attempt to chat with her.
>
> Peter Edwards, an expert in mental health law for 23 years who is
> representing him, said: ``If Lord Bicester was plain old Mr Smith I
> don't think he would have been locked up for nearly so long. His
> eccentricity has the ability sometimes to embarrass people in high
> places - he knows a lot of them and his family is related to some of
> them.
>
> ``It is an absolutely tragic story of a wonderful man who is very
> eccentric and who, for reasons of misfortune, has spent about all of
> his adult life locked up.''
>
> Mr Edwards said Lord Bicester has never been a danger to himself or
> others. He is allowed to leave the hospital with doctors' consent
> but has to return at pre-determined times or face arrest.
>
> Lord Bicester, a bachelor, inherited his title from his uncle,
> Randal Smith, three years after the psychiatric order was
> made. Randal's father, Vivian Smith, was a partner in the banking
> firm Morgan Grenfel and was raised to the peerage in 1938. The
> family seat was Tusmore Park, near Bicester, Oxon.
>
> Yesterday, as commissioners approved by the Health Secretary
> adjourned the hearing for two months, Lord Bicester spoke of his
> desire to have his Lords voting right reinstated while leaving a
> bookmaker's shop in York. He had just lost £7 on the 3.10 at York
> and was returning to the Retreat.
>
> ``I'm in touch with the House every day,'' he said. ``I ring them to
> find out what's going on.''

> ### `Artistic' baron launches bid to rejoin peer group
>
> Martin Wainwright on an eccentric's effort to regain his seat in the
> House of Lords
>
> An elderly peer, known fondly for handing out abstract drawings on
> the streets of York, yesterday launched a fight to resume his place
> in Britain's government after 31 years in compulsory psychiatric
> care.
>
> The third Baron Bicester, whose grandfather ``Rufie'' took the title
> after chairing the aristocratic stockbrokers Morgan Grenfell, began
> a tribunal appeal to permit his return to the House of Lords.
>
> The move follows claims by a friend that the peer, born Vivian
> Smith, is effectively a ``political prisoner'', unable to test his
> family motto Tenax in Fide (Steadfast in the Faith) on the
> crossbenches.
>
> Lord Bicester's solicitor, mental health specialist Peter Edwards,
> also said that the baron's knowledge of people in high places and
> ability to embarrass them meant that he was treated differently
> ``than if he was plain old Mr Smith''.
>
> Detained under the Mental Health Act since 1965, the Old Etonian's
> regime at the private, Quaker-run Retreat hospital in York is
> relaxed, with genial attendance at the annual pantomime and frequent
> unaccompanied local trips outside the three acre grounds approved by
> the medical staff.
>
> Bookmakers and casual acquaintances in York describe him as ``an
> amiable gent and a lovely man'' who potters about with a pad of A4
> paper, offering brightly coloured swirls signed ``The Lord
> Bicester'' for charity.
>
> Yesterday, he paused briefly at he favorite bookie's in Hull Road to
> comment on the opening of his appeal tribunal at The Retreat.
>
> ``I'm in touch with the House every day,'' he said, after wryly
> disclosing that a £7 bet had just flopped on the 3.10 at York's
> Knavesmire racecourse. ``I ring them to find out what's going on.''
>
> His greatest wish, he said, was to take the place of his grandfather
> and Uncle Randal, the second baron who was High Sheriff of
> Oxfordshire, in the Lords.
>
> Born Angus Edward Vivian Smith, son of a Coldstream Guards colonel
> and a mother from New York, Lord Bicester was sectioned under the
> Mental Health Act at the age of 33 and has been treated at a
> succession of different hospitals.
>
> His family has brushed with controversy in the past, particularly
> over the demolition of their country seat Tulsmore Park, near
> Bicester, and its replacement with a much-criticised neo-Georgian
> mansion.
>
> Nine years ago, the 3,000 acre estate was bought by the Syrian-born
> Mr Fixit, Wafic Said, the businessman and close friend of Mark
> Thatcher.
>
> Earlier this year, Mr Said dropped plans to build a third Tulsmore
> Park, a £20 million baroque replica of Palladio's Villa Rotunda
> which would have been the largest new country house in Britain since
> the Second World War.
>
> The Retreat had no comment yesterday on Lord Bicester's case but it
> is understood that his treatment, in consultation with his trustees,
> allows the local excursions under discression given to doctors in
> Mental Health Act.
>
> He is known as ``Lord Angus'' in a number of local pubs where he
> courteously offers his artwork with a polite: ``I do this for
> charity; if you would like it, please give me as much as you can
> afford.''
>
> Mr Edwards said: ``He's a delightful, eccentric, elderly
> gentleman. If he was plain old Mr Smith. I don't think he would have
> been locked up for so long. But his eccentricity has the ability to
> embarrass people in high places, and he knows a lot of them -- his
> family are related to some of them.''
>
> Community care consultant Nigel David, from Guildford, Surrey, has
> befriended Lord Bicester, whose well-spoken assertions that he is
> connected to the Queen -- not always uncommon in psychiatric
> hospitals -- carry more weight than usual.
>
> He said: ``He's a charming character, full of fun and with an
> exceptionally retentive memory, although he's usually drugged.
>
> ``The fact that he is locked up with people who are genuinely ill is
> terrible.''

> **Presenter:** A bizarre hearing was held into the case of a member

>
> **Collin Brazier:** Trusmore Park in Oxfordshire, for generations
> the ancestral home to one of the nations' most distinguished
> families. But for the last thirty years the current Lord Bicester
> hasn't been able to enjoy the life he was born to, confined instead
> to secure mental institutions. The Retreat Hospital in York is the
> latest. And it was here today that a Mental Health Review Tribunal
> met to decide whether he ought to be discharged.
>
> **Peter Edwards (Solicitor to Lord Bicester):** I'm very surprised
> to still find people like Lord Bicester in the mental health
> system. He has been detained for most of his adult life. And I
> believe that people should try a great deal harder to rehabilitate
> him into the community. He's got a wonderful sense of humour. How
> he's been able to preserve his personality over so many years of
> incarceration is absolutely amazing.
>
> **CB:** Today's hearing was adjourned for two months while more
> detailed psychiatric reports are compiled. Lord Bicester's legal
> team and friends are angry that he remains institutionalized. They
> claim he ought to be cared for in the community as he's been no
> danger to himself or others since his problems as a teenager.
>
> **Countess Ilona Esterhoze (Friend of Lord Bicester):** We have to
> go back to his probably teenage years around thirteen when he was at
> Eton he heard the sad news that his parents were going to split
> up. And this was, I think, quite a shock for him.
>
> **CB:** His years at Eton still warrant a mention in Who's Who but
> the abrupt end to his entry gives, friends say, some clue to his
> subsequent treatment at the hands of the establishment.
>
> **CIE:** I think at times he was seen as an embarrassment to the
> house, not because of what he said but because people didn't like to
> hear what he said.
>
> **Noel David (Community care consultant):** Because he is on of the
> eminent members or potentially members of society I think his
> colleagues might find his behaviour which is, his sense of humour,
> slightly embarrassing.
>
> **CB:** Friends of Lord Bicester stress their legal moves have
> nothing to do with the standard of confinement at the Retreat which
> they describe as exemplary.

>

>
> Initially he will need supervision and medication, and the tribunal

>
> Lord Bicester could attend the Lords only as a visitor while he was
> detained under the Mental Health Act. He is now entitled to play a
> full part in proceedings. He said he would campaign for reform of
> the mental health laws.

> **By Paul Wilkinson**

> A peer who has spent the past 32 years in mental institutions was
> preparing yesterday to take his seat in the House of Lords as a
> Conservative.
>
> Angus Edward Vivian Smith, 64, the 3rd Lord Bicester, has just been
> told that he can take his first steps towards leaving a home and
> resuming life in the outside world. The decision by an independent
> mental health tribunal in York is a triumph for friends of the Old
> Etonian. They claimed that Lord Bicester was no longer a danger
> either to himself or the public at large. He was released briefly in
> the mid-1980s but was returned in 1988 soon after apparently
> stopping the car carrying the Princess of Wales on a street in
> Kensington "for a chat".
>
> On hearing the decision he said: "I am now looking forward to
> sitting in the House of Lords and seeing a few old friends. I will
> probably sit with the Conservatives." The tribunal recommended that
> he can leave the Retreat pyschiatric hospital in York.
