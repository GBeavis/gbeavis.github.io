Concrete buildings
------------------

One of the most noticeable features of the York Campus is the way all
the original buildings are made of prefabricated slabs of
concrete. The building design is known as C.L.A.S.P., and was
specially developed for the York Campus.

Two main reasons have been given for adopting the prefabricated
building style at York. Firstly, the campus was to be built as quickly
as possible. (The University was only founded in 1963, yet the first
students started in 1964, with building work still going strong.)
Secondly, there was not a large skilled labour force available in York
to build a conventional style of building. It was calculated that
building the University would need some 700 men, about 20% of the York
labour force at the time. (There was also apparently a national
shortage of bricks in the early 60's, and it is possible that
shallower foundations are needed with CLASP - worth considering since
the ground is very marshy.)

The CLASP system was first developed by local authorities who needed
to build school buildings as quickly and cheaply as possible. The
first building in York to be built using CLASP was the `New' building
in Heslington Village. This had wooden cladding of the external walls.

CLASP (Consortium of Local Authorities' Special Programme) was based
on a steel frame with cladding panels, and flat roofs. The design
allowed production of components that could quickly be erected on
site, whilst enabling flexibility of design, and changes during the
lifetime of the building.

Before any major building work was done, the design of the system was
improved. The main difference is the use of prefabricated concrete
cladding panels, which significantly increased the durability and
fire-resistance of the design. Contrary to campus folklore, there is
no life expectancy of the panels, and they have been found to be
relatively cheap to maintain and easily adaptable over the past 30
years. Properly maintained, the buildings should last as long as any
other. It would have been possible to make the concrete panels in
different colours to add variety, but it was cheaper and quicker to
have them all the same.

There are a number of stages of development of the CLASP system in the
University. Derwent, Langwith and Chemistry are built from Mark III;
Alcuin and Vanbrugh from Mark IIIb; Goodricke and Biology from Mark
IV; and Wentworth (1970) from Mark V.

Although visually similar to the rest of the old colleges, parts of
Wentworth college is built using conventional methods, with
load-bearing internal walls. This is because at the time these parts
were built (1975), there was not enough money to build it using the
more flexible CLASP methods.

Since the late 70's, buildings have been constructed of more
traditional materials. (Individual items such as Central Hall and the
Concert Hall have also had their own designs.) By the Development
Review in 1985, only 55% of buildings on campus were built of CLASP
materials.

Sources: *Nouse* Issue 10 (Thur 28th Oct 1965), University Development
Plan, University Development Plan Review.

There's a book on CLASP in King's Manor Library, but it covers later
development techniques than those used at York.

The `New' Building
------------------

The `New' Building (yes, that is how it is written on the sign
outside) is in Heslington Village, just before you get to the Charles
when coming from campus. It was the first building to be built for the
University, dating from 1962 (?). It was needed to supplement the only
other teaching accomodation on campus, the converted Heslington Hall,
which did not contain any large rooms suitable for lectures. The `New'
Building was built from the original prefabricated CLASP system, and
was erected in just 5 months.

The `New' Building is now home to the Norwegian Studies Institute.

For a while before the existence of the Science Park, this building
effectively served some of the same functions as the innovation
centre - a number of high-tech startup companies, mostly spinoffs from
the university, were based there including York Software Engineering,
Hand Whittington and Associates and HCI.

Central Hall
------------

I think the best thing to do here is quote from *Nouse* No. 18
(Thursday, 23rd June 1966):

> ### Central Hall Plans Finalised
>
> Plan for the Central Hall have now been finalised and were recently
> open to inspection. The hall, which should be open by the end of
> 1968, is planned as being one of the focal points of the university
> and for this reason its site will be at the centre of the colleges,
> when they are completed. Its position between college five and
> Langwith will be on a promontory position jutting into the lake , it
> will then be artificially surrounded by the lake by the formation of
> a pool behind the building.
>
> The hall is to be used for such functions as dances, ballet, and
> theatre productions, although preference is to be given to lectures
> and to examinations. It is already tentatively booked for five or
> six conferences.
>
> Architecturally, the exterior of the building has what might be
> described as a strong nautical flavour, as it does not look unlike
> the superstructure of an aircraft carrier, made of concrete. The
> roof of the building is to be made of copper or aluminum (depending
> on the current price of copper) and there is to be a `spire' which
> will be held to the roof by guy ropes, these being partially to hold
> the structure together. There are to be balconies and paved ways
> around the building overlooking the lake.
>
> The foyer is to be built underneath the main stage area and it will
> additionally be used as an exhibition space. A rehearsal room,
> lecture theatre, debating chamber and robing room are also to be
> added. The full capacity of the hall will be 1,250, although by a
> system of curtaining the size may be reduced, so that the tiering
> around the sides may be screened off.

The list of rooms to be added at the bottom is quite impressive and
would take up as much room as the hall itself. As far as we know none
of these were built, has anyone been backstage?

The article was accompanied by photos of the architect's model of the
completed building, which as far as we can tell is exactlyhow it was
built.

The acoustics have always been described as `dry' because of it's
intended uses, and some experiments have been made to improve them. An
artificial resonance system was installed, the same design was used in
the Festival Hall in London - the tubes hanging from the gantries
above the audience are Helmholtz resonators. More recently, the Arts
Council funded the installation of a canopy over the stage with a
reflector incorporated - sadly it is not really in the right place as
it would block the projector, and a movable reflector was too
expensive.

Library
-------

The J B Morrell library is named after a founding father of the
University, John Bowes Morrell.

The original campus development plan was hoping for a more impressive
building than the one that was built - constructed on a terrace
projecting from the hillside over a large car park on two levels,
including various social facilities. The building would have formed a
bridge over University Road.

The library was built as part of Phase 3 of the original university
development plan, and was completed in June 1966. The structure is
precast concrete. The library was extended in 1987 at the back,
providing more space for books and students. A further extension is
now (1999) being planned.

The internal design has been criticised since it was built. The open
staircase in the middle, together with the use of hard materials such
as ceramic tiles, makes the library a noisy place in which to
work. When first built the issues desk was on the first floor,
directly above it's current position. This created so much noise that
a canopy had to be provided above it, which is still there.

The roof of the original building was replaced in 1992/3 due to
disintegration of the original asphalt and chipboard flat roof.

### Bookshop

From 1966, Godfrey's had a small shop within the library. The current
bookshop was built by them in 1978. The sign on the library pointing
to Godfrey's lasted many years after the shop was changed to
Blackwells.

Physics
-------

The Physics building is one of the more prominent buildings on campus,
and unfortunately is also one of the most ugly. Once again, a quote
from *Nouse*, this time Thurs, May 11 1967:

> ### Million Pound Fun Palace for Physicists
>
> By November of this year York's physicists will have moved from the
> temporary home in the chemistry laboratories and into their own
> labs. across the lake from the central hall. The new buildings,
> costing nearly a million pounds, have been built with full
> consultation between the architects and Prof O S Heavens, the head
> of the physics department.
>
> Great efforts have been made to produce a versatile building; none
> of the internal walls support the roof, so if a larger area of space
> is needed it can be obtained by knocking down a few walls. The
> research wings can be extended by simply removing the clasp walls
> and building outwards.
>
> The presence of vibration in the chemistry labs, makes them far from
> ideal for physics, which often involves highly sensitive
> apparatus. In the new labs the effects of vibration have been
> considerably reduced by building the research wings on foundations

> set in cork to prevent the transmission of vibrations to other parts
> of the building. Specially sensitive instruments will be mounted on
> concrete pillars set deep into the earth.
>
> One of the wings will be air-conditioned; this air-conditioning

>
> The last job of the contractors will be to cut away the arch from

> theatre jutting dramatically out over the lake.

As far as is known, the helium plant was never built (Mike Page-Jones
reports that it did exist, but was shutdown sometime after the
electronics departments' creation (ie late 70's) due to tightening of
safety regulations -- It'd be nice to hear this from someone that was
around at the time).

The Physics Department Newsheet 4, 29 March 1984 has this short
article

> ### The Name Game
>
> The Physics building is now shared by two departments and, in some
> ways, it is unfortunate for our Electronics colleagues that they are
> in the Electronics Department in the Physics building. The situation
> can be made better for them, and prehaps a little more interesting
> for us, if the building had a name so that, for example, the
> Departments of Electronics and Physics were situated in the ``X
> building'' where X was some suitable name.
>
> If a suitable name can be found then it could be submitted to the
> Vice-Chancellor and/or Council for approval. I invite members of
> both departments to submit suggestions for a name to me by the end
> of April 1984. A small committee will then be set up, with
> representatives of both departments, to select the most appropriate
> name from those submitted. For the person suggesting this name,
> whether or not it is finally approved, there will be a prize of a
> bottle of whiskey.
>
> Prof Woolfson

The official name of the Physics building changed to the Physics and
Electronics Building in 1986.

Some extensions have been made to the sides of the building, notably
the Electronics Workshop during 1996. An even cheaper way of doing
this is to add Portakabins to the outside. Also today (3/9/96) workmen
are busy knocking a wall down inside, to make one room into two.

In 1993 the concourse area was extended by the Conference Office. The
following item appeared in the *News Sheet* (December 1992):

> ### Waterfront exhibition area planned
>
> The University's lack of a large indoor space for major exhibitions
> is set to end with a new extension to the concourse area in the
> Physics and Electronics Building. The single storey extension will
> extend the perimeter of the existing concourse and P/X001, P/L001
> and P/L002 and moving it nearer the lake. This will increase the
> concourse's current gross area of 500 square metres to 900 square
> metres.
>
> Many conference organisers hold exhibitions as part of their
> programme. The new concourse will mean that the University may
> attract new conference clients and also that the marquees and
> pavillions erected from time to time over the summer should become a
> thing of the past. There will be room for 60 to 65 stands in the new
> concourse but flexible screening means that the area will have the
> potential to become several exhibition areas or a mixture of
> teaching and exhibition rooms.
>
> During term time the new extension will result in three new teaching
> spaces: a computing area for the Electronics Department and two
> centrally timetabled rooms for teaching; and a reception and lounge
> area for departments.
>
> The plans also incorporate a number of other features: a larger,
> permanent home for the Vickers Collection; a seminar room; the
> replacement of the snack bar by vending machines under the main
> staircase; improvements to the entrance from Goodricke College; a
> public address system for conference visitors; the enlargement of
> the Porters' Lodge; additional card and cash telephones;
> enlargements to the Senior Common Room; the filling-in of the
> stepping stones across the lake to allow wheelchair access; the
> probability of a glazed screen around the first floor mezzanine
> which will reduce noise and smoke levels.
>
> Work will begin on the extension in June 1993 and is is expected to
> be finished by the end of the summer vacation. During the summer
> temporary footpaths will be laid from Central Hall and Goodricke
> College to the teaching block of the Physics/Electronics
> building. In the meantime enquiries about the extension should be
> directed to the following people: Alan Strong (computer
> classroom/mezzanine/common room); John Nash (two teaching rooms);
> Roy Whitaker (catering); Harry Milner (Porters' Lodge); Richard
> Hainsworth (exhibition space).
>
> Architects' plans giving detailed information on the extension are
> currently on display in the Physics/Electronics building.

The extension work included the enlargement of the Senior Common Room;
enclosure of the first floor mezzanine; modification of the Ladies
toilets; adding wooden panels to the central staircase; and putting a
new fire exit staircase to P/X001.

The concourse was opened on 4th October 1993 by the Chancellor, Dame
Janet Baker.

In 1998, plans are afoot for the University to remove the central
stairs and fill in the mezzanine to provide office and lab space. This
will enable the conference office to make more use of the room
currently used as the Electronics computer room.

Observatory
-----------

The Department of Physics observatory is in the middle of a field
behind the sports centre. The grand opening was reported in the
November 1993 *University Magazine*:

> ### The Chancellor opens the Observatory...
>
> The day was wet and windy, the ground a muddy bog, but the occasion
> was a happy celebration of success. Protected by wooden pallets
> underfoot and armed with comforting mulled wine, guests of the
> Physics Department joined the Chancellor and the Astronomer Royal,
> Professor Arnold Wolfendale, in the opening of the University's
> Observatory on 2 December.
>
> The small neat building is deceptive. It has two storeys, a
> revolving roof and a 14 inch Schmidt-Cassegrain reflecting telescope
> mounted on a massive equatorial fork mounting. This observatory has
> been built to professional standards and will enable Physics
> students and staff to carry out astronomical teaching and research.
>
> The Astronomer Royal praised the Observatory and commented on the
> success of Astronomy in the north of England over the centuries,
> including that of John Goodricke. ``Some of our ideas are right too,
> aren't they Michael?'' he said to Professor Michael Woolfson. They
> both shook their heads.
>
> The Chancellor expressed thanks to the many local firms, including
> Ibstock Brick Ltd, Bovis Construction Ltd, William Birch and Sons
> Ltd and Whitby Oliver and Sons Ltd, for the gift of materials and
> labour for the Observatory.
>
> That done, guests had the chance to see through the telescope for
> themselves.

The top dome of the observatory is floating on a water tank, to allow
it to be turned round easily. There is no heating in the dome, since
the rising hot air could distort the telescope's view.

Electronics
-----------

The new electronics building, next to the car park, was built in
1987/8. The following article appeared in the University *News Sheet*,
Issue 195 (June 1987):

> ### New Building for Electronics
>
> This autumn the Department of Electronics will be increasing its
> annual intake of undergraduates from 45 to 70, and there will be a
> corresponding increase in the number of staff. New undergraduate
> courses are bwing planned in Avionics and in Physical Electronics,
> the latter in conjunction with the Department of Physics.
>
> Since this expansioino cannot be accomodated in the present Physics
> and Electronics Building, a new building is about to be constructed
> alongside it, as shown in the diagram. [This may follow later. www]
> Most of the space in this new building will be occupied by the
> following three Electronics groups which need facilities that cannot
> be provided satisfactorily in the old building and which now have
> laboratories specially designed for them:
>
> 1. the Microelectronic Devices Research Group, which will have a
>    clean room for fabricating micro-electronic devices;
> 2. the Electromagnetic Compatibility Group, which will have a
>    screened room for research on electrical interference; and
> 3. the Electronics Centre, which undertakes design and development
>    work for industrial firms, particularly in the York area.
>
> Moving the three groups into the new building will free space in the
> old building to accomodate the additional undergraduates and staff,
> and to allow some expansion of other research groups. The
> self-financing Electronics Centre will be paying for the part of the
> building it will occupy, and the rest of the building is being
> financed by the University, with the aid of a £40,000 grant from the
> UGC.
>
> The project has been designed by the University's architects, RMJM
> London Ltd., in association with the University's Services
> Engineer. The quantity surveyors are Messrs. Franklin and Andrews.
>
> As shown in the diagram, the new building is to be situated to the
> west of the Physics and Electronics Building at the end of the
> wings, in such a way that two new courtyards are created. Its gross
> area will be approximately 750 m². The plan is organised around a
> corridor, running north/south with large laboratories to the west
> side and TSO's and small labs on the east. The Electronics Centre is
> to the south of the main entrance and reception area.
>
> The main entrance will face west to the car park and is to be marked
> by a lattice tower. This supports the entrance canopy and will be
> topped by disk aerials.
>
> The building is to be single storey, brick faced with a low pitch
> aluminum roof. At the south end there will be an area of flat roof
> where dish aerials will be mounted. The structure will be steel
> framed with partitions of dry construction.
>
> Work on the main contract will start late September 1987, and will
> be completed in April 1988. There will be some preliminary work
> undertaken in July in order to divert existing services.
>
> The details of the scheme, for which planning permission is being
> sought, will be considered by Estates and Buildings Committee on 30
> June. The plans will be displayed in the Physics and Electronics
> Building during July.

Chemistry
---------

One of the first buildings on Campus, originally all science
departments were there.

There is a plaque on A block which has the following text:

> THIS LABORATORY\
> WAS OPENED BY\
> HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS\
> THE DUKE OF EDINBURGH\
> ON 22 OCTOBER 1965

Chemistry is perhaps best known for the large water tower in the
middle of it.

Part of the building was extensively damaged by fire in 1980.

B block was extended in the summer of 1993 (by filling in what were
garages) to provide extra teaching space. The C block labs were also
refurbished at the time, to make research labs.

Biology
-------

The main architectural feature of the biology buildings is the tall
clock tower, with it's single face pointing towards (most) of campus.

The building was damaged by a serious fire in 1973.

The Institute of Applied Biology, started in 1986 in the biology
department, moved to it's own buildings on 6 November 1989. Money for
the buildings came from the University and from Rowntree plc.

The Department of Biology Cancer Research Unit has the following
plaque on it's wall:

> These laboratories were given to\
> the University of York\
> by the\
> Yorkshire Cancer Research Campaign\
> on 13 May 1980

A new set of labs was built during 1994, as reported by the November
1994 issue of *University Magazine*:

> Professor Jo Milner and her research team have just moved in to
> their new cell biology laboratory, in the ground floor of a new
> biology laboratory complex. Their research has led to important
> understanding of the cancer growth suppressing function of a protein
> called p53. The Yorkshire Cancer Research Campaign, which funds
> Professor Milner's Chair and supports the team's work in other ways,
> donated £400,000 towards the cost of the laboratory.

Another greenhouse-type extension has been built during 1996, at first
floor level on the part of the old building nearest the plant lab.

Plant Lab
---------

One of the most distinctive buildings on campus, the Biology Plant Lab
was opened in 1995, as reported in the June 1995 *University Magazine*:

> ### Importance of plant biology heralded by laboratory opening
>
> The official opening of the University's Plant Laboratory takes
> place on Friday 2 June.
>
> The laboratories have been purpose built to accommodate the
> University's rapidly expanding plant science research base. The
> recent appointment of a number of new researchers combined with
> existing strengths has resulted in an impressive concentration of
> expertise in molecular plant science.
>
> Research in the new laboratories is aimed at understanding
> fundamental aspects of plant biology such as how plants recognise
> and respond to environmental stimuli like wounding, nutrient stress,
> drought and shade.
>
> Since we rely heavily on plants for basic necessities like clean
> air, food, clothing and shelter, is is essential that we understand
> more about plant biology.
>
> ``The Plant Laboratory provides an environment for a
> multi-disciplinary group of enthusiastic and imaginative young
> scientists to work together,'' says Professor Dianna
> Bowles. ``Increasingly, we are working with other specialist groups
> on campus and with researchers in industry on novel ideas in plant
> biology that will ultimately lead to new products in the market
> place.
>
> The plant research initiative has already been highly
> successful. The new building houses nine research groups comprising
> some 50 scientists. The research income generated by York plant
> biologists has come to over £3m in the last year alone.
>
> Funding has come from the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences
> Research Council, The Royal Society, The Wolfson Foundation and from
> leading UK companies including Zeneca, Glaxo, SmithKline Beecham,
> AgrEvo and Unilever.
>
> New links are being established with a number of European and US
> industries.
>
> The Plant Laboratory opening will be celebrated on a day on
> International Science Lectures by some of the world's leading plant
> biologists. They include Professor Keith Roberts of the John Innes
> Centre, Professor Ramon Serrano of the University of Valencia,
> Professor Jeff Schell of the Max Plank Institute fur
> Zuchtungsforschung, and Professor Tom Blundell FRS, of Birkbeck
> College.

Psychology
----------

Psychology used to live above Wentworth A block, which is attached to
the rest of Wentworth by the glass-stairs thing in the air. Plans were
made for their own building in 1974, when the department was first
formed, but due to government cutbacks it was never
built. Construction of their new building started in 1993, with Phase
1 complete in January 1994. The *University Magazine* (February 1994)
reported on Phase 1:

> ### Psychology's new home
>
> At the end of January the University took possession of the first
> phase of the new home for the Psychology Department. Having
> languished for nearly 20 years buried in converted study bedrooms in
> Wentworth College, the Department asked architects Hunt Thompson
> Associates for a building with its own distinct identity. Now that
> the building is completed we can see how well they have satisfied
> this brief. Within a very tight budget the architects have given us
> a new building of real interest of which even our last
> Vice-Chancellor would be proud of!
>
> The exterior is dominated by the circular tower (with its
> distinctive spiral brickwork) which houses the main stairs, lift and
> provides circulation space. It also forms the link to Phase 2 of the
> building, due to rise from the mud later in the year. The main block
> of the building, under a curved roof, houses many of the facilities
> needed by the growing number of Psychology undergraduates - a large,
> computer-based teaching laboratory, workshops, test library and the
> departmental office - but rather little space for staff and their
> research groups. Only four members of the 14 strong lecturing staff
> are moving their research laboratories into this first phase of the
> building.
>
> The realisation of this building and the allocation of funds for
> phase 2 brings closer the day when all of the 5-star rated
> Psychology Department will be under one roof and the Department's
> long quest for a home will be over.

The commencement of Phase 2 was mentioned in *University Magazine*
November 1994:

> ### Work begins on second phase of Psychology building
>
> Phase two of the Psychology Department building will be constructed
> by local company William Birch and Sons.
>
> The contract, worth £903,000, began in October and will finish in
> Sepember 1995. The building will provide new lecture and seminar
> rooms for undergraduate teaching and specialised laboratory space
> for the Department's research groups.
>
> To make life easier for pedestrians during construction, a new
> floodlit pathway leading across the front of Psychology to the
> Sports Centre, has been built adjacent to the road which
> construction vehicles will use.
>
> Phase o nen of the new departmental building was completed in
> January. With the completion of Phase two, staff and students in one
> of Britain's most successful Psychology Departments will finally be
> together on one site.

The final completion was described in the March 1996 issue of
*University Magazine*:

> ### Fanfare for Psychology Opening
>
> On 17 February, the Psychology Department celebrated the opening of
> its new building. Dame Janet Baker unveiled the plaque and
> trumpeters assembled on the tower of the building blasted out a
> fanfare as the Department's own flag was hoisted to flutter above
> the campus.
>
> Over £2 million has been invested in the new building, which was
> designed by architects Hunt Thompson Associates and constructed in
> two phases.
>
> Members of the Department and illustrious guests then gathered in
> the teaching laboratory to hear the distinguished psychologist,
> Professor Wichard Gregory, who is Emeritus Professor of
> Neuropsychology at Bristol University, deliver an excellent lecture
> entitled `Why Psychology is Special'.
>
> The celebrations continued with refreshments and tours of the
> research laboratories for the visitors.
>
> The Department has waited a long time for its own building. Student
> numbers have climbed rapidly in recent years. The annual intake of
> around 40 in 1989 has grown to over 100 in 1995. On average 125
> applications are made for every place. Its popularity with students
> coupled, with its research strength - top rating in all three of the
> government's research assessment exercises - has made Psychology one
> of the most successful departments in the University.
>
> Plucked from the obscurity of converted study-bedrooms in Wentworth
> College, the Department of Psychology can at last enjoy first-rate
> facilities for its wide range of research groups from human-computer
> interaction to behavioural neuroscience from dyslexia to
> psycho-acoustics.

The new Psychology building bears the following plaque:

> THIS BUILDING WAS OPENED\
> ON 17 FEBRUARY 1996\
> BY DAME JANET BAKER CH DBE\
> CHANCELLOR OF THE UNIVERSITY

This item from the July 1996 *University Magazine*:

> ### University building in national exhibition
>
> The new Psychology building has been selected from over 100
> applications to be represented in an exhibition of `Buildings for
> higher education' organised by the RIBA Architecture Centre and the
> Higher Education Design Quality Forum.

Sports Centre
-------------

The original plans for the Sports Centre were reported in the Thur
10th Feb 1966 issue of *Nouse* (full quote to follow at some point):

> ### New Sports Centre
>
> The completion date for the first stage of the University of York
> Sports Centre is now in sight...
>
> The first stage has now been given U.G.C. approval and it is hoped
> to start on it this summer...

The plan shown includes a swimming pool at one end, 2x large halls,
squash courts, then a grandstand at the other end. The first stage,
that which was authorised, was a hall and changing rooms.

In 1989, a three-phase improvement plan was started. Extra changing
rooms for outside sports were added, and the entrance area was
improved with the addition of reception, porters lodge and
offices. Work was carried out in three phases, and was finally
completed in the Winter 1990/1.

### Swimming Pool

The quest for a swimming pool at York has been running for many long
years now. More than once it has been announced that building was
about to start, such as this article from the *University Magazine* June
1994:

> ### All set for a splash
>
> Whether you like to pound away at 20 lengths before breakfast, or
> splash around at your leisure, a quick dash across campus for a swim
> is about to become a reality.
>
> The University is set to realise a long-held ambition by building a
> swimming pool. Building work is expected to start this autumn. The
> pool will cost £750,000 to build and the University already has
> £350,000 in grants and donations.
>
> The new pool will be situated between the Sport Centre and the
> Observatory.

There is also a mention of the funding for the pool, in the October
1994 edition of *University Magazine*:

> ...Now, at last. we expect to build a swimming pool, thanks to a
> generous benefaction from Greg Dyke, Politics Department, 1971-74,
> and a contribution of £100,000 from the Foundation for Sports and
> the Arts. A pool would serve the daily needs of up to 7,000 staff
> and students, and some 40,000 visitors each year...

Sadly, staff and students get to stay dry for another year, as the
pool has yet to be built. (Running costs are believed to have been the
problem.) The following article appeared in the March 1995 University
Magazine:

> ### Scheme scuppered
>
> Plans for a swimming pool on campus have been halted after Policy
> and Resources Committee decided the scheme was too expensive.

(How do you scupper a swimming pool? Oh well. Ed)

### Hockey Pitch

The latest addition to the sports facilities at York has been the
building of the floodlit astroturf hockey pitch, in the centre of the
running track. This was partly funded by Greg Dyke, using the money he
had wanted to spend on a swimming pool (see above). The hockey pitches
were used from summer 1996, but the official opening was not until
November, as described in the December 1996 *University Magazine*:

> ### Floodlit hockey match launches York's new all-weather pitch
>
> A team of former York students took on the Athletic Union
> President's side in a floodlit hockey match at the opening of the
> University's new all-weather pitch on Saturday 30 November.
>
> The pitch was opened by Greg Dyke, Chairman and Chief Executive of
> Pearson Television. The new facility is designed to complement and
> enhance local sport provision and provide a much-needed
> all-year-round pitch.
>
> The £563,000 project includes a floodlit hockey pitch, five changing
> rooms and car parking. The pitch is available for full-scale hockey
> matches, five aside football, and practice sessions for other
> sports.
>
> Floodlighting to enable the pitch to be used all year round is
> adjustable with high settings for matches, lower settings for
> training and the ability to light half and one-third areas for
> small-scale uses, thus saving on energy costs.
>
> The building of the pitch was generously funded by Greg Dyke, a
> former student of the University, and the Foundation for Sport and
> the Arts. The pitch will be known as the JLD Hockey Pitch in memory
> of Greg Dyke's father Joseph Leonard Dyke.
>
> ``The pitch is a significant addition to our sports facilities'',
> said Colin Smith, Director of the Sports Centre. ``Not only will it
> help us in attracting students to the University, but it is an
> important part of the region's sports facilities. Current users of
> the new pitch include York Men's and Ladies' Hockey Clubs, York City
> Football Club, Fulford School, the University College of Ripon and
> York St John, St Peter's School and Dunnington Football
> Club. University hockey is also flourishing as a result of this
> pitch: we are currently running three men's and two ladies' teams.''

IRISS
-----

The IRISS buildings are built in the modern campus style of yellow
brick and dark tiled roof. Work started in 1988, and is mentioned in
the University *News Sheet*, Issue 200 (May 1988). The total cost of the
development was estimated at £1.6m.

Music
-----

The new extension of the Music Department was started in 1991, as
described by this article from *News Sheet* Issue 219 (March 1991):

> ### Work begins on new Music extension
>
> Work has just begun on an unusual new building for the Music
> Department.
>
> The extension, a single storey building linked to the rest of the
> Department by a covered way, will curve around to enclose an
> attractive landscaped area and will incorporate an overlooking
> glass-windowed corridor. It will be of traditional construction in
> facing brickwork to harmonise with the existing building and will
> have a natural slate roof overhanging the eaves level windows to
> provide sun protection.
>
> The extension will provide additional rehearsal and practice space
> and will include a small hexagonal auditorium which will mirror the
> stage area of the Sir Jack Lyons Concert Hall so that rehearsals can
> be easily transferred to the main hall. The building will also
> provide a new home for the south east Asian Gamelan and Pi-phat
> ensembles.
>
> Mike Nicholas and Rob Marsh of Nicholas Associates are the
> architects in charge of the building which will be finished in
> September ready for the new academic year.

The opening was covered by *News Sheet* in December 1991 (issue 225):

> ### New Music Extension opens
>
> The new extension to the Music Department is up and running. The
> single-storey building linked to the rest of the Department by a
> covered way comprises rehearsal and practice space and includes a
> small hexagonal auditorium which mirrors the stage area of the Sir
> Jack Lyons Concert Hall.
>
> It also provides a new home for the Javanese Gamelan and Thai Piphat
> ensembles.
>
> The building curves around to enclose a small landscaped area and
> has been built in brick to harmonise with the existing building.

### Sir Jack Lyons Concert Hall

A concert hall featured in the original development plan, attached to
a music department, but could not at first be built to to a lack of
money. Sir Jack Lyons donated the £120,000 needed by the University to
build the hall, and his wife donated the cost of t he ebest piano that
could be found.

The hall seats 500 people, and the stage layout is duplicated by a
Music Department practice room.

Computer Science
----------------

(Computing Science computer history is on a
[separate page][compcomps].

The computer science department has a history of upgrading to new
accomodation. Formed in the late 70's out of the
[computation department][computation], which lived in the two original
blocks, the department has had offices in Chemistry, Vanbrugh and X/A
block (amongst other places).

The main building (X/D block) went live in '85-ish. This was joined by
X/E block in 88 (real-time and high-integrity groups initially), and
X/T (portakabin initially used by HISE comp. sci researchers, then
ITBML) in '91. This was built right over a water main and had to have
a large hole made in its floor, in addition to lacking a toilet. It
was a cold and rather bleak place to work. The department kept
*nearly* leaving Vanbrugh -- computer architecture group was replaced
there by what later became the Intelligent Systems Group. X/U block
was added in 1992.

In the courtyard between the old and new buildings there is a large
chessboard in the paving stones.

The new building has a weather vane at one end, calibrated in radians
rather than the more conventional NESW.

Work is now (Autumn 1996) under way on a still newer building, to go
next to the library. Most of the Computer Science buildings will
apparently be given to EEMS when the new building near the library is
complete. It was mentioned in the February 1996 *University Magazine*:

> ### Computer Science building to go ahead
>
> Outline planning consent has been given for the new Computer Science
> Building. All being well, work will begin on the site in June this
> year. Completion is scheduled for September 1997. Permission has
> also been given for 17 acres of playing fields to be built on land
> near the golf club.

You can keep up to date with the construction of the new building,
thanks to this link to Computer Science.

The original plan was to build an access road round the back of the
library. Plan scrapped, (reason unknown). Instead the current access
road for the construction vehicles would be used as the main feed
road. So the same single foreman, who is in charge of the construction
sight and the road construction had put in the plans/project details
that the road would be built, surfaced and completed over a number of
weeks. Unfortunately, that time was also the time he had allocated for
the moving of the dept, so there was going to be the department, all
ready to move into but no road to get to it (they would have to tear
up the current access road as it has no drainage.) The problem remains
unsolved at this stage, though it looks like they will build a
temporary road next to the existing road for the dept to move in, tear
up the existing road, resurface it, then remove the temporary road.

University Health Centre
------------------------

Originally, the University Medical Centre was in converted rooms in
Vanbrugh B block, at the corner near X block. It was moved to a
purpose-built building, and renamed, in 1994. This article comes from
the *University Magazine*, January 1994:

> ### University Health Centre opens for business
>
> The University's new Health Centre, set between the
> Physics/Electronics building and the Vice-Chancellor's house, opened
> on 7 January. The purpose-built Centre has three consulting suites,
> two treatment rooms, a sick bay with adjoining night nurse
> accomodation, multi-purpose nurse's interview room and office, a
> conference room and a spacious waiting room with a welcoming
> reception area which includes confidential facilities.
>
> ``The Centre has been built to our requirements and provides first
> class facilities on campus for health care,'' said Dr Keith
> Price. ``There is room for further expansion of services and we have
> full facilities for the disabled as well as 24 hour nursing cover
> throughout the week during term. We now have a perfect opportunity
> to involve the full Primary Health Care Team on campus and, in our
> role as GP fundholders, we will be able to provide a greater variety
> of health care services.''
>
> ``One of the special things about the Centre is its site,'' said
> John McNeil of McNeil and Beechey Architects. ``It stands on the
> edge of the tree nursery overlooking the lake and in the spring the
> Centre will be surrounded by flowers amongst the trees. The building
> has been designed to make the most of this wih continuous glazing
> providing pleasant views from all of the rooms.''
>
> The building has been finished to a high standard on difficult site
> conditions. ``The builders, William Birch, and their subcontractors
> are to be congratulated,'' said John McNeil.

University Nursery
------------------

The Nursery occupies a quiet site behind the Physics Department on
campus. It was opened in 1989, and was extended in 1994 to include a
Baby Unit, opened on 14 October by the Chancellor.

Student Centre
--------------

York S.U. are still battling to get a `proper SU building', but for
the time being they have offices and stuff in the converted squash
courts next to Goodricke Bar. The news was reported in the January
1995 issue of *University Magazine*:

> ### New Student Centre opens
>
> The Students' Union and its key affiliates have been brought
> together for the first time in a new Student Centre next to
> Goodricke College.
>
> Students' Union Officers, RAG, Community Action Project, the
> Overseas Students' Association and the Graduate Students'
> Association moved into the new building in December.
>
> The building also provides space for non-sabatical officers and for
> several Students' Union societies.
>
> The new Student Centre has been converted from a building containing
> two squash courts. Twenty-four windows were inserted into a
> previously windowless building, changing rooms were converted into
> toilets and a new fire escape and a lift for disabled access have
> been added.
>
> The conversion cost around £240,000 with contributions towards that
> of £88,000 from the Students' Union and £12,000 from the Graduate
> Students' Association.
>
> ``We now have much better facilities,'' said Jon Bloch, Deputy
> President (Services). ``Previously we worked in very cramped
> conditions in our Goodricke Colleges offices.''
>
> The Union President, the Deputy President (Services) and RAG and CAP
> staff work in an open plan area upstairs designed to make the Union
> more accessible to its members. The Welfare Information Officer and
> Deputy President (Welfare) have their own offices to preserve
> confidentiality, as do the Finance Officer and the Administrative
> Officer.
>
> On the ground floor there is a general office and reception, where
> the new receptionist Caroline Snowdon greets visitors, the AU
> offices, a joint GSA/OSA office and a print room.
>
> ``The Students' Union and its affiliates would like all students to
> feel that they can use the building's facilities,'' said Jon Bloch,
> ``and we hope that they will aid the Students' Union in its efforts
> to improve services for students on campus.''

Careers Centre
--------------

The careers centre was built in 1985, at the same time as the Computer
Science building. It has a large grey box on the roof, purpose
unknown.

Drama Barn
----------

The drama barn stands between Vanbrugh College and the Music
Department. Part of this building dates back to the 19th century, and
was part of Bleachfield Farm which used to stand on the site.
