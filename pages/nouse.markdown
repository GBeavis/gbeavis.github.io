One suggestion that is often suggested is that it is a contraction of
``No Use'', there is some evidence that that is partially the case.

In the first copy of Nouse (Nov 23 1964) the editor gives this
explanation for the name:

> For any who may be puzzled about our choice of title the connotation
> of the greek Nous is intelligence of comprehension, Ouse is after
> the river Ouse chosen to include an indicator of the locality and if
> pronounced Nooze this becomes in phonetic terms News

In the Feb 16 1967 edition of Nouse a letter critisizes the paper for
incorrectly spelling the greek **Nous** in its title. The editor at
the time quoted the remarks above and added that

> Nouse also incorporates No and Use.

Although we don't know if this was spotted when the name was first
proposed.
