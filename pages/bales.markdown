The bales of straw in the lake were introduced following a very green
year: in summer 1993 the water turned very green. The introduction of
the bales was reported in the October 1994 University Magazine:

> ### Feeding straw to the lake
>
> The campus lake will be fed straw this year in an effort to keep
> down the algae blooms which cover it every summer.
>
> Fifteen bales of straw wrapped in wire mesh will shortly be seen
> floating in the lake. The effect they have will not be noticable
> until next year, however.
>
> ``The bales have an arresting effect on the growth of algae,'' says
> Gordon Eastham, the University's new supervisor of grounds. ``But
> they need to be put in the water six months before the algae blooms
> to have the desired effect.''
>
> The bales, which will be anchored to prevent them drifting, will
> float at first but will become submerged as they are
> waterlogged. Marker buoys will be attached so that grounds staff can
> identify them and remove them after six months.
>
> ``It is partly a cosmetic exercise,'' says Gordon, ``but the water
> quality will be better when there are fewer algae blooms.''
