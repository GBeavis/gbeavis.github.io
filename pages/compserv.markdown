(As you can see there are a lot of gaps in the early history here. If anyone has more details we would be glad to hear them.)

1966
----

Summer
~ York's first computer delivered: an Elliott Automations
  machine. Programs can be written in Algol, Fortran or Neat (the
  assembly language for 4100 computers).

1969
----

- New computer delivered - ICL 1900 - with punch cards, paper-tape &
  genuine (magnetic) core memory. Charles Stanley-Smith ran his final
  year project to model Fluro Cyanide (FCN) on it. It took 7 hours to
  run and came up with the answer of 42 (Angstroms).

- Programming in Algol & Fortran, was achieved by writing programs on
  special sheets (Pink for Algol and Blue for Fortran) and submitting
  them, results (usually compile errors) were returned 24 hours
  later. Backups were another shoe box full of punch cards.

- There was also a connection to Leeds, where they had a ICL 2900.

1972
----

- PDP-11 bought as front-end to the increasingly creaky ICL 4130 and
  give online access to strategic points around campus. They ran
  something called the Kent Online System or KOS.

1976
----

- ICL 1900 pensioned off.

- DEC KL10A arrived, was dropped during unloading, and promptly
  reloaded and shipped back to DEC. A second one arrived and took, as
  expected, far longer to install than had been allowed. A new wing of
  the Comp. Center was built to accomodate the new system. It
  generated so much heat that the air conditioning spewed clouds of
  steam out of the vents on the University Road side of the building.

Computer Details
----------------

### DECsystems

Introduced in about 1972, later on there were two - a KS10 and a
KL10. The KS10 was apparently largely used by computer science, the KL
by the rest of the university.

### VAX

The first incarnation of the VAX at York was a two-processor cluster,
as reported in the University News Sheet Issue 190 (October 1986):

> #### VAX cluster for York
>
> The University has just replaced its DEC KL1090 computer system with
> a VAX cluster. Initially the cluster consists of two processors: an
> 8650 with 32 Mbytes of memory, and an 8200 with 8 Mbytes. They run
> the VAX/VMS operating system and support 120 users. The processors
> share disk and tape storage. There are two tape drives and twelve
> Winchester disks with a total capacity of 6 Gbytes. Printing
> facilities consist of a line printer and a laser printer. There are
> no card or paper tape facilities on the system.
>
> Fortran, Pascal, Basic, Simula, Cobol, C, and Ada are the languages
> supported, and about 20 packages and libraries are available.

The tape drives were 6250/1600 bpi units. The line printer could churn
out 600 lines per minute, the laser printer a respectable 12 pages per
minute. Operating system was originally VMS 4.4(?), upgraded to 5.1-1
in 1989, then to 5.2 and 5.3 in 1990, and 5.4 in 1991.

The two computers were called VAXA (the 8650) and VAXB (the
8200). This original VAXB couldn't cope with the load and was replaced
by an 8550 within a year. From autumn 1988, users could just type
`CALL VAX' and were automatically connected to the one with the lowest
load.

TCP/IP (in the form of UCX) arrived on the Vax systems only after the
installation of Unix systems in the computing service and the threat
or promise of JIPS.

The two VAXen were removed in Summer 1993, but were replaced by a
single machine, vax. It is a Microvax 3100 model 90, about four times
more powerful than each of the old two. The old magnetic tape drive
was not attatched to the new VAX, as use of such tapes was being
phased out.

Readers of late-1980 era Keynotes may remember the cartoon strip
featuring the two VAXen talking to each other. Below are a few
excerpts:

> ``This isn't why I became a VAX... I wanted to work for NASA''

> VAXA ``What's 2 + 2?''
>
> VAXB ``I don't know, you're the clever one.''

What do all the letters mean? Here's a guide from the March 1990
Keynotes:

VAX
~ Virtual Architecture Extension. The type of computer used by the
  Computing Service. So called because it was developed as as
  `extension' to an older and simpler design of computer.

VMS
~ Virtual Memory System. The Operating System that runs on the VAX
  computer and gives it its particular personality. VAXes can also run
  other operaing systems, such as UNIX.

DEC
~ Digital Equipment Corporation. Also known as
  `Digital'. Manufacturers of the VAX computer and the VMS operating
  system.

DCL
~ Digital Command Language. The normal user interface to the VMS
  operating system. Also known as a `command interpreter'. This is the
  language you use to give commands to the VAX to list directories,
  run programs etc. The familiar $ prompt is a sign that the system is
  waiting for a DCL command to execute. Some other command
  interpreters exist - for example SHELL, which allows Unix-like
  commands to be given instead of DCL.

Notable locally-developed VAX software included the BBS system
**Jorvick**, a Bullet-III lookalike, though unlike BBS systems
elsewhere this was never really intended for outside access. Sadly,
Jorvick was never rewritten to run on tower, and some of the
functionality has been taken over by the newsgroups. There have also
been a couple of attempts in the late 90s to start a Campus Moo, a
multi-user realtime world based on the University (like a mud without
the fighting). This never took off, although we still have the
database...

### WORD

VMS Wordperfect System, introduced in 1990 to take the load off of the
VAXcluster which was running WPS+. At first the system was
WordPerfect 5.0 running on 3 MicroVAX 3100 computers, called WORDA,
WORDB and WORDC. As with the VAXcluster, users could type `CALL WORD'
and were connected to the one with the lowest load. The software was
upgraded to WordPerfect V5.1-1 in April 1992.

Along with the replacement of the VAX cluster in 1993, the WORD
cluster was also updated to a single, more powerful unit.

### tower

Silicon Graphics Challenge system. 64 Mb memory, increased to 96
Mb 1992.

When delivered, had four 33 MHz processors. Upgraded to eight in 1994
by adding four 44 MHz processors. At the same time, the memory was
doubled to 192 Mb.

Replaced in 1994(?) by a newer machine, called for a while newtower 4x
200-MHz processors.

Replaced again in 1998, by a Sun Ultra10. 500 Mb memory, but only one
processor. (Fortunately, the similarly-specced mailer took most of the
load from tower).

### ebor

Delivered and installed circa July 1994. Silicon Graphics 8x 150-MHz
processor Challenge Deskside system.

Replaced in 1998 by a Sun Enterprise 3500, 6 processors at 366 MHz and
1 Gb memory.

### goodram

Auspex NS6000 file server, purchased late 1993. Central SUN-4 host
processor, with NFS traffic handled by microprocessor modules
interconnected by an Enhanced VMEbus backplane operating at
55MByte/s. These are a File processor, an Ethernet Processor, an FDDI
processor, and the Storage processor. There is also an io cache. The
Storage processor can handle 20 SCSI devices. When delivered goodram
had one FDDI processor and one Ethernet processor, and 12Gb of disk
space in 3Gb disks. This was upgraded to 15Gb at the start of 1994.

### pump1, pump2

Sun Ultrasparc 2200 servers, introduced in October 1997 to handle news
and mail respectively.

### crypt1, crypt2, crypt3

Network Appliance filers, the first 2 installed October 1997. Disk
capacities were 36 Gb and 72 Gb respectively.

Upgraded and joined by a third in summer 1999, now F740 models. Total
space 160Gb.
