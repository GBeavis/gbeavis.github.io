`vuft' was the world-famous Computer Science terminal room at
York. (see the Computer Science Folklore to find out why it is called
vuft.) When the department moved to it's shiny new building next to
the library in September 1997, vuft was closed. The following obituary
appeared in the york.cs newsgroup:

> A short period of packet silence will be held in memory of Vuft.
