> The Rose, which he suggests should be located in the lake between
> James College and Wentworth, would be the only one of it's kind in
> the country. He chose the design because ``The University needs a
> symbol, something close to York city itself. The Rose was the
> obvious choice.''

> It has been designed to open and close automatically when water
> falls onto it (either by rainfall or a fountain) and it is painted
> white with special thermo-sensitive paint, which will turn dark red
> when the temperature falls below freezing.

> Joseph is adamant that the design will not cost the University a

> build the Rose will come from charities. ``The York Common Good
> Trust has offered some financial help, but I need more,'' he said.

> ``It's still a long way from being built, and is only on the second

> A lot of research went into the design of the Rose and, where

> University's Chemistry Department and will not cause pollution by
> running into the lake.
>
> The Rose will work silently so as not to disturb students and the
> structure can hold three times it's own weight, so will stand up to
> the rigours of students trying to climb it.
>
> Joseph is no stranger to designing and sculpting. He has sculptures
> in Prague, Tokyo and the University of California. He has also
> sculpted for the National Children's Home, to help raise money. The
> Rose is just one of his latest projects.

> Some students were not impressed by the design, saying it was
> ``ugly'', ``outrageous'', and ``a bit of an eyesore'', but most
> thought ``it would make a nice change'' or ``brighten up the
> campus''.

> However the University's Art Committee Secretary, Philip Simison,
> stated that, ``The idea has not actually been approved by the
> University, although we are looking to the future by trying to
> identify possible sites for new sculptures.''
